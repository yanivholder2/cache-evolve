# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three single-knob tweaks were tried on the cycle 0002 line: a further smaller small queue (v001), a shorter ghost queue (v002), and a lower freq cap in main eviction (v003). Only v001 won, with a small gain. v002 reported a small gain over its parent but is not among the Winners. v003 was slightly worse.

## Patterns

- The small-queue ratio gain is flattening. This halving gave much less than earlier steps, so the lever is close to exhausted on this trace.
- A shorter ghost helped, or at least did not hurt. That is the opposite of cycle 0002's longer ghost, which hurt. Ghost length now looks like a real admission filter, and shorter means stricter.
- Another attempt to age main entries faster (a lower freq cap) lost a little. Across cycles, ageing and decay changes have lost every time. This workload rewards keeping reuse history.
- Evidence still comes from one trace at one cache size, and every gain is small and may be within noise. Metadata-size and per-op-time were unmeasured for the fourth cycle running.

## Open questions

- Is the v002 shorter ghost additive with the v001 small queue, or does it just overlap with the stricter-admission effect?
- Where does the ghost-length gain turn over? Does it hurt when reuse distances are long?
- Does the very small probation window weaken filtering on scan-heavy or other traces?
- Are the small gains real, or noise from a single trace?

## Continuation

Keep v001's smaller small queue as the base and stop tuning the ratio. Pursue stricter admission instead: a shorter ghost (combined with v001), or a stricter ghost-hit or promotion rule. Drop all ageing and decay variants, including freq cap and halving. Validate on a second trace and cache size, and restore the metadata and per-op-time measurements.
