## Prior cycles digest

### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three stricter-admission tweaks were tried: a shorter ghost combined with the small-queue shrink (v001), a promotion gate one freq level stricter (v002), and a ghost-hit fast path into main only if freq > 0 (v003). Only v001 won, by a marginal gain. v002 tied its parent and v003 was clearly worse.

## Patterns

- Admission-side sizing (small ratio, ghost length) now looks saturated. The shorter ghost and the smaller small queue are not additive, and the combined gain is tiny.
- Making the promotion gate stricter had no measurable effect. Either the gate is not a binding lever on this trace, or the change did not alter behaviour.
- Filtering ghost hits hurt the most. A ghost hit is strong reuse evidence, and with a very short small queue, keys sent back through small are evicted before they can prove themselves again.
- "Stricter admission wins" holds only for ghost length. It fails for the ghost-hit path, and it is untested for promotion.
- Only hit-rate was measured, again. Evidence is still one trace at one cache size, and the variant authors could not inspect the overlay source.

## Open questions

- Did the v002 gate change actually alter which keys get promoted, or was it a no-op?
- Is any remaining admission or capacity lever worth tuning, or is the S3-FIFO structure at its local optimum on this trace?
- Do these small gains hold on a second trace or cache size?
- Can metadata-size and per-op-time be restored?

## Continuation

Stop tuning capacity ratios, ghost length, and promotion thresholds, and keep v001 as the base. Keep the ghost-hit fast path permissive, and consider loosening it only for ghost hits, not for general promotion. Explore structurally different levers, such as main-eviction policy or reinsertion rules, and verify that each diff changes behaviour. Validate on a second trace and cache size, and restore the metadata and per-op-time measurements.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three structurally different main-queue and ghost-path tweaks were tried: a one-time reinsertion grace for ghost-admitted entries (v001), protected-end insertion of high-freq small-queue victims into main (v002), and a per-key freq flag in the ghost, with re-admission at freq=2 (v003). None improved hit-rate. v002 is the Winner only because it tied its parent, while v001 and v003 were marginally worse.

## Patterns

- Nothing moved hit-rate. This is the second cycle running in which the best variant merely tied the parent. The S3-FIFO structure looks close to a local optimum on this trace.
- Both variants that gave ghost-admitted keys extra credit (a grace pass, a boosted freq) lost slightly. Ghost-hit information is already used well by plain admission, and extra protection keeps entries that stop being reused.
- The main insertion position (v002) looks like a weak lever. Either few victims reach the threshold, or main's reinsertion logic washes out the position difference.
- Variant authors still could not read the overlay source, so we cannot tell whether v002's change was a no-op. The tie is ambiguous.
- Metadata-size and per-op-time were again missing, and v003 added ghost state with no signal. Evidence is still one trace at one cache size.

## Open questions

- Did v002 alter behaviour at all, or is it equivalent to its parent?
- Is any remaining lever on this trace worth the effort, or are we measuring noise?
- Do these null results hold on a second trace or cache size?
- Can metadata-size and per-op-time be restored so cost can be compared?

## Continuation

Treat v002 as a neutral base; prefer the simplest parent if it is cleaner. Drop ghost-hit bonuses, per-key ghost metadata, and main insertion-position tweaks. The next cycle should validate on a second trace and cache size, and restore the metadata and per-op-time measurements. Only try new levers (such as main-eviction scanning or reinsertion rules) if the diff is checked to change behaviour.


### Cycle 0006

# Cycle 0006 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three variants were tried. Two changed main-queue eviction: a bounded lookahead that picks the lowest-freq entry (v001), and a cap on reinsertions per eviction (v002). The third (v003) combined known admission settings: main evictees go to the ghost, a very small small queue, and a shorter ghost. Only v003 won, with a hit-rate gain. Both eviction variants lost a little.

## Patterns

- Every change to main-eviction mechanics lost hit-rate. Replacing reinsertion with lookahead lost, and capping reinsertion depth also lost. The unbounded second-chance reinsertion scan is doing real protective work.
- The one Winner is a consolidation of earlier admission gains (small queue shrink, shorter ghost), plus ghost insertion of main evictees. It adds no per-key state. This again points to admission sizing, not eviction, as the lever that moves this trace.
- Ageing freq in place for skipped entries (v001) fits the older finding that ageing and decay changes lose here.
- Cost was still unmeasured. Variant authors still could not read overlay source. Evidence is one trace at one cache size, so small regressions may be noise.

## Open questions

- Which part of v003 carries the gain: ghost insertion of main evictees, or the re-bundled sizing?
- Does v003's extra ghost work on `put` cost meaningful per-op time?
- Does the gain hold on a second trace or cache size?

## Continuation

Adopt v003 as the base. Drop main-eviction rewrites (lookahead, reinsertion caps, freq ageing) and keep the parent's reinsertion semantics. Next, isolate whether ghost insertion of main evictees helps, and validate on a second trace and cache size. Restore metadata-size and per-op-time measurements so cost can be compared.
