# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three probes of the small-probation segmented LRU were tried: a fixed 2-slot probation (v001), a recency-stamp compare that lets stale protected entries be evicted (v002), and a lean positional 4-slot split rebuilt on the baseline with no extra state (v003). Only v003 was a Winner; v001 and v002 each lost a little hit rate against their parents.

## Patterns

- The probation-size trend has turned. Going below the slots/16 sizing slightly hurt, so the current size is at or near the optimum and further shrinking is exhausted.
- Eviction-side tweaks did not help. Letting raw recency override probation-first eviction cost hit rate, because the segment boundary already encodes reuse evidence that one last-access stamp does not capture.
- Together with earlier cycles (ghost history, delayed promotion, frequency windows, size tuning), most simple levers on this split have now been tried and found flat or negative. The simple structural split holds almost all the gain.
- v003 again shows that a lean positional split with no ghost, counter or adaptive state improves on plain LRU. Its comparison is against the baseline, not an increment over the current best.
- Per-op-time and metadata-size were unmeasured for the fifth cycle running. v003's "lean" claim (same footprint and speed as baseline) is still untested, and promotion/demotion reordering on hits is still unpriced.

## Open questions

- Does the lean split really keep baseline metadata size and per-op-time, and do the gains survive once those are measured?
- Is there any remaining hit-rate headroom in promotion or protected-segment handling, or is this design at its ceiling for the trace?
- Does the result hold on traces other than the LIRS-style one, or is the tuning specific to it?

## Continuation

Treat the lean 4-slot positional split (v003, with slots/16 probation sizing as the reference) as the base. Drop further probation-size shrinking and recency- or stamp-based victim overrides. The next cycle should first get per-op-time and metadata-size into the fitness vector; after that, try only mechanisms that add no per-entry state, or check robustness on other workloads.
