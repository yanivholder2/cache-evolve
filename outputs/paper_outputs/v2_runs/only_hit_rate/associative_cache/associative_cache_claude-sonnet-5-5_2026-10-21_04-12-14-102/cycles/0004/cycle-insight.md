# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three probation-segment variants were tried: shrinking probation further (v001), a stricter two-hit promotion rule (v002), and a minimal fixed probation share built directly on the baseline geometry (v003). The two Winners were the small-probation variants (v001, v003). The stricter promotion rule lost hit rate.

## Patterns

- Two independent routes both ended at a small probation segment (about 4 slots per bucket) and both won. The trend toward smaller probation has not clearly turned, but the gain from v001 is marginal and looks to be flattening.
- v003 reports a large gain over plain LRU without the cycle 1-3 additions (ghost rings, counters, adaptive state). This suggests the simple split plus small probation captures most of the benefit, and the extra bookkeeping from earlier cycles may be unnecessary.
- Delaying promotion hurt (v002). With a small probation segment, entries cannot wait for a second hit without being evicted. Together with cycle 0003's ghost result, first-hit promotion looks hard to beat here.
- Per-op-time and metadata-size were unmeasured for the fourth cycle running. Every claimed win is hit-rate only, and the cost of segment reordering and demotion on `get` is still unpriced.
- v003's comparison is against the baseline, not the current parent, so its size is not an increment over v001.

## Open questions

- Where is the actual minimum of probation size? Is going below 4 slots (for example 2, or 1) still better, or does scan resistance break?
- Does v003's simple split match the full accumulated stack, and can the older extra state be removed?
- Do the hit-rate gains survive once per-op-time and metadata-size are measured?
- Would a larger probation segment make a two-hit rule viable, or is first-hit promotion simply better?

## Continuation

Probe probation sizes just below the current point (and one above, as a check) to find the turn, and consider simplifying by stripping unneeded earlier state, using v003's lean split as a reference. Drop two-hit or other delayed-promotion rules in a small probation segment. Fix the evaluation so per-op-time and metadata-size appear in the fitness vector before adding any new bookkeeping.
