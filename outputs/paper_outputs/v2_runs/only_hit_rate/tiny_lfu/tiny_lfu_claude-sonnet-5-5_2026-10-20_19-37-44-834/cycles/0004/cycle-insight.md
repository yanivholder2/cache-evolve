# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three cost-oriented or structural tweaks were tried: halving the sketch row width (v001), growing the protected segment share of main (v002), and deriving all row indices from one 64-bit hash (v003). v002 was named Winner but matched its parent exactly on hit-rate. v001 lost hit-rate, and v003 held hit-rate level.

## Patterns

- The Winner is a tie, not a gain. Its status comes from not regressing, so the protected/probation split looks irrelevant on workload-a at this cache size.
- Changes that leave frequency estimates intact (segment split, single-hash row derivation) were neutral. Changes that degrade estimate quality (narrower rows causing more counter collisions) lost hit-rate. This matches the cycle 2 and 3 theme: preserve frequency information.
- v001 contradicts the cycle 1 reading that the sketch is over-provisioned. Halving width is too aggressive, while hash-sharing (v003) appears safe.
- For the fourth cycle running, the fitness vectors report hit-rate only. Metadata-size and per-op-time, the stated goals of v001 and v003, are still unmeasured, so no cost trade can be judged.
- Variant authors again could not always read overlay source, so explanations rest on hypothesis text and fitness vectors.

## Open questions

- Does the single-hash change actually reduce per-op-time? That is unverified.
- Would a gentler width reduction than 2x keep hit-rate while saving size?
- Is workload-a simply saturated, so that no structural tweak can move hit-rate on it?

## Continuation

Fixing the evaluation is now the blocker: add metadata-size and per-op-time to the fitness output, plus a second trace (shifting popularity or a different cache size), before generating more hypotheses. Keep v003's single-hash indexing as a candidate cost win to verify on speed. Drop protected-segment sizing and further 2x width cuts. If tuning sketch size, try a smaller step and judge it on size.
