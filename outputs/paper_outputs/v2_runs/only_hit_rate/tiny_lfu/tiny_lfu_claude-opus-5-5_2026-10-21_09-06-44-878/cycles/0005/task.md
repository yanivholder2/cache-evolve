## Prior cycles digest

### Cycle 0002

# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants kept the same contest and changed one admission-adjacent lever each. v001 used frequency-sampled victim selection among the oldest LRU entries. v002 added long-period halving aging with no conservative update. v003 made the W-TinyLFU window adaptive with a hill-climber. Only v001 won, and its hit-rate gain was marginal. Both other levers lost hit-rate on workload-a.

## Patterns

- Freshness keeps losing on workload-a. Aging alone, without conservative update and over a longer period, still hurt. It hurt less than the cycle-0001 combined change, so most of that earlier damage came from conservative update and/or the short period.
- Strict `>` with keep-victim-on-tie runs through every result. Halving creates ties that newcomers lose. Victim sampling helps only a little, because the oldest entries are uniformly cold or still carry stale-high estimates. Tie handling in the contest has now been named as the bottleneck in two cycles and has never been tested directly.
- Restructuring and adaptation don't pay off on this trace. A naive climber pushed the window toward a larger, LRU-like region, which this LIRS-style trace punishes. That contradicts cycle 0001's hunch that the window was too small.
- Per-op-time and metadata-size are still unmeasured for the second cycle running. v001 adds sketch estimates on miss-puts and v003 adds per-get bookkeeping, so neither latency cost has been checked.

## Open questions

- Does a `>=` contest, or one with a tie-breaker (such as a doorkeeper or a random admit on ties), beat strict `>`, both alone and combined with v001's sampling?
- Would a larger sample, or one placed somewhere else, make victim sampling matter, or is the head region simply cold?
- Would a warmed-up, damped climber with small steps (and a contest on shrink) recover anything, or is a fixed small window simply right for this trace?

## Continuation

Build on v001 and target the contest directly: test `>=` or tie-breaking admission first, then try that with a wider or alternatively placed victim sample. Drop sketch aging and naive window hill-climbing on workload-a. Revisit aging only as a very long period paired with a tie-aware contest. Insist on a run that reports per-op-time and metadata-size, so v001's extra estimates and v003-lineage hashing are actually priced.


### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants built on cycle-0002 v001 (sampled victims), and each changed one lever. v001 admitted the newcomer on warm ties. v002 widened the victim sample. v003 widened the count-min sketch. Only v003 won. Its gain was clearly larger than any earlier policy tweak, while both contest/sampling levers lost hit-rate.

## Patterns

- The real bottleneck was estimate quality, not the contest rule. Cleaning up collision noise helped. Admitting on ties and searching for victims more deeply both hurt, because they act on estimates that are misleading in two ways: they are inflated by collisions, and they never age, so they reward lifetime counts.
- Strict `>` with keep-victim-on-tie is now tested and should stay. Tie-admission mostly swapped one cold key for another. The get-miss-then-put replay bumps the sketch twice per new key, so a fixed estimate threshold cannot single out one-hit wonders.
- When estimates never age, the lowest estimate marks the youngest resident, not the coldest one. Widening the victim sample therefore evicts recent, still-useful keys. Victim sampling looks exhausted as a lever.
- Part of the "stale-high" inflation blamed on missing aging in earlier cycles was actually collision overcount. Earlier aging results were confounded by this noise.
- For the third cycle running, per-op-time and metadata-size went unscored. v003's larger sketch has a real memory cost that has not been priced yet.

## Open questions

- Now that collision noise is reduced, does very-long-period aging, or doorkeeper-style dedup of the double get/put increment, finally help? Or does lifetime frequency still win on workload-a?
- Is there more to gain from an even wider sketch or a different depth, or has it already plateaued? What is the memory/latency trade-off?

## Continuation

Build on v003, the wider sketch, and treat it as the new baseline for every estimate-related comparison. Next, target estimate meaning: try a doorkeeper or dedup of the get-then-put double count, re-test long-period aging against this baseline, and sweep sketch width/depth while metadata-size is reported. Drop tie-admission and wider victim sampling. Keep insisting on a run that scores per-op-time and metadata-size.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants built on the cycle-0003 wide sketch and each changed one thing about what the estimates mean. v001 deduplicated the get-miss-then-put double count. v002 added conservative update. v003 added very-long-period halving aging. Only v001 won, by a small margin. The other two were flat, within noise.

## Patterns

- Making estimates more accurate has stopped paying off. On the 16×-wide sketch, conservative update made no difference, because collision overcount is already gone from the minimum row. Width and conservative update fix the same error, so their gains don't add up.
- Aging is now settled as negative for workload-a. It still didn't help on a clean sketch at a very long period. This confirms that the earlier "stale-high" blocking came from collisions, not from genuinely old popularity. Lifetime frequency is the right signal for this trace.
- Making counts honest helped, but only a little. With dedup, sketch counts match true access counts, so keys that keep missing no longer outrank residents that collect counts through hits. But a first-time newcomer still ties a resident that was accessed once, and the newcomer loses that tie.
- The sketch side (width, update rule, aging, dedup) now looks used up as a hit-rate lever. Over four cycles, the only large gain came from removing collision noise.
- This is the fourth cycle in a row where per-op-time and metadata-size went unscored. v001 should lower per-op cost (one hash per get, and fewer increments), but that has not been measured.

## Open questions

- Is the remaining hit-rate in the resident structure instead? For example, a small window or doorkeeper in front of the main region, or an SLRU probation/protected split, now that estimates are clean and honest. These were only tested earlier on the noisy sketch.
- How much can the sketch shrink before hit-rate drops, now that conservative update can make up for collisions at a narrower width? This matters once metadata-size is priced.

## Continuation

Build on v001 (wide sketch with dedup) as the new baseline. Drop further work on sketch accuracy, all aging, tie-admission and wider victim sampling. Next, re-test structural levers on the clean estimates, such as an SLRU-style protected/probation split or a small fixed window. If metadata-size is finally scored, run a narrower-sketch-plus-conservative-update test to recover memory. Keep demanding per-op-time and metadata-size reporting.
