# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort tried three edits, all aimed at metadata and lookup cost rather than eviction policy: capping the ghost population below main-queue size, replacing per-queue key scans with id-indexed hash lookups, and storing ghost entries as fingerprints in a hash set. All three were labeled Winners. The fingerprint ghost and the index change have the clearest cost rationale; the ghost cap is the only one with a hit-rate movement, and that movement rests on a single trace.

## Patterns

- The fingerprint ghost is the third cycle in a row to show a put-path benefit with no hit-rate change (after Cycles 0003 and 0004). Its gain is again on the put side, and its cost is container-level bookkeeping, not per-entry size.
- Ghost size moved in opposite directions across cycles with opposite results. Enlarging the ghost to full capacity (Cycle 0004) lost hit rate; capping it at half the main queue here gained a small amount. On the evidence so far, a smaller ghost population looks closer to what the workload needs.
- The index change removed the per-put resident-key scan and the per-hit queue walk. Hit rate was unchanged because eviction and promotion logic were untouched, and the cost is fixed container state rather than per-entry bytes.
- Get-path timing moved in one variant whose get code is unchanged, which matches the shared-noise pattern from earlier cycles. The index change is the first get-path edit with a direct speedup rationale, but it still needs a baseline rerun before the credit is taken.
- Whole-structure footprint is the right unit for these changes. Each Winner grew the container while leaving `Entry` alone, so per-entry size is no longer a useful proxy.
- The three edits touch overlapping state (ghost storage in two of them), so their gains may not add together. None was tested in combination.

## Open questions

- Does the fingerprint ghost's put-latency gain hold across traces and capacities, and does its hash-set cost stay acceptable at larger sizes?
- Does the half-main ghost cap keep its small hit-rate gain on other traces and capacities, and does it still help once the ghost is stored as fingerprints?
- Does the id-indexed lookup keep its get and put speedup under a baseline rerun, and does the extra index state matter at larger sizes?

## Continuation

Next cycle should validate the fingerprint ghost on more traces and capacities, since it now has three cycles of consistent put-side benefit. Test the half-main ghost cap on additional workloads, and try it in combination with the fingerprint ghost before treating either as settled. Drop further ghost enlargement toward full capacity. Re-run a get-path baseline before crediting the index change's get speedup.
