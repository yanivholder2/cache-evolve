# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort tried three edits: stacking a lowest-frequency victim choice on the larger small queue, frequency aging on main-queue rotation, and a fingerprint-keyed ghost queue. Only the fingerprint ghost shows a clear, attributable benefit (put-path latency). The other two show no hit-rate gain and no attributable benefit, so their Winner labels are weakly supported.

## Patterns

- The one clear win came from the put miss path: replacing stored ghost keys with fingerprints removed per-eviction key handling, and that change is what moved put latency.
- The fingerprint ghost's cost is in memory and tail risk, not hit rate: the cache-level bookkeeping grew, and ghost hits now scan the ghost queue linearly.
- Victim choice did not compose with the larger small queue from Cycle 0002. Once the small queue holds the larger share, the rotation budget likely runs out less often, so the victim change has little to act on.
- Frequency aging left hit rate unchanged on the one trace reported, so its effect is untested rather than shown to be neutral.
- Two of three variant insights report empty "Helped" sections and rest on hypothesis text because overlay source could not be inspected. Mechanism claims remain unverified.
- Get-path timing moved again without any get-path edit, matching the shared-noise pattern from Cycles 0001 and 0002.

## Open questions

- Does the fingerprint ghost keep its put-latency gain on more traces and capacities, and does the linear ghost-hit scan show up in tail latency at larger sizes?
- Does the victim choice ever help once the small queue is enlarged, or is it only useful in a regime where the rotation budget is exhausted often?
- Does frequency aging change eviction on a trace where the second-chance pass actually runs long?
- Is the get-path shift real, and is it reproducible with no code change?

## Continuation

Next cycle should validate the fingerprint ghost on more traces and capacities, and check its ghost-hit tail latency before treating it as a settled Winner. Drop the stacked victim choice on top of the 20% small queue, since it lost hit rate on the trace tested. Hold frequency aging until a trace shows it changing evictions. Re-run a get-path baseline before crediting any get-latency change.
