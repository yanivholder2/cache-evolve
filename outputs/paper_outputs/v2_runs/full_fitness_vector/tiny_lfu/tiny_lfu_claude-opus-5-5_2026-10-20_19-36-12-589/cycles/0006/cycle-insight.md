# Cycle 0006 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort moved from the sketch to the structures around it. v001 replaced the LRU list with CLOCK reference bits. v002 replaced the std map with a custom index table that stores only node indices. v003 added a 10% admission window and folded in the fused sketch increment. All three are listed as Winners, but only v001 is a clean step forward: smaller per-entry metadata with hit rate unchanged. v003's latency gain comes from the fused increment, not the window. v002 brought no gain.

## Patterns

- Admission doesn't depend on exact recency order. CLOCK's coarse second-chance order left hit rate flat, so exact LRU position was never giving the duel any useful information. Per-node links can go without losing quality.
- Windows are now ruled out at both sizes. The ~1% window (cycle 0005) and the 10% window (this cycle) both lowered hit rate. Workload-a rewards strict frequency filtering at the door. Any capacity given to unfiltered arrivals goes mostly to one-hit keys.
- Median `get` cost doesn't sit in relinking or in hashing twice. Removing relinks (v001) and removing the duplicate hash (v002) both left the `get` median unchanged. The only change that moved latency was the fused register-held sketch increment (v003). That suggests cycle 0005's failure to carry this gain over was bench drift, not a real regression.
- Tail costs show up on the rare paths. CLOCK's unbounded sweep, and v002's second probe plus re-hashing during backward-shift deletion, both made `put` p99 worse. Structural changes need to keep eviction-path work bounded and free of extra hashing.
- A custom index that stores only node indices does worse than SwissTable. Every probe then has to load from `nodes`, which costs more than the hash it saves.

## Open questions

- Does word-at-a-time sweeping (`trailing_ones` over a `u64` of ref bits) bring CLOCK's `put` tail back to LRU's O(1) level?
- Would an index that stores hash tags or home slots beat std `HashMap`, or is the map simply not the bottleneck?
- With recency structure, sketch accuracy and duel inputs all used up, is workload-a's hit rate at its ceiling for this design family?

## Continuation

Use v001 (CLOCK) as the new base. Merge in v003's fused increment without the window, and bound the sweep with word-level bit scanning. Confirm the latency side by side against both parents. Drop admission windows of any size, and drop index-only custom hash tables. Treat further hit-rate work as low-yield. Prefer metadata and tail-latency reductions that keep the duel and the hit rate unchanged bit for bit.
