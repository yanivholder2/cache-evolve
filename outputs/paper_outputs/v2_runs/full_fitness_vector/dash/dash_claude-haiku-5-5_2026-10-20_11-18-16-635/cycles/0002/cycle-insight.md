# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort split into two families: insert-position gating on target-bucket fullness (v001), and changes to victim selection and stash handling (v002, v003). Only v003's change clearly targets hit rate, and its gain is measured on a single workload. All three are labelled Winners, but v001 and v002 each carry recorded regressions that their Winner status does not obviously offset.

## Patterns

- Gating promotion insert position on fullness moved the wrong way: placing promotions at the front of full buckets cost hit rate, so promotions into full buckets still need the protection the back-of-queue insert gave them.
- Protecting hot residents works better at eviction than at insert. Biasing the victim choice by a small saturating access counter is the only change that reports a hit-rate gain, which fits the cycle 0001 concern about displacing hot target residents.
- Stash-path bookkeeping does not pay on this workload. Adding an occupancy check to the get path and maintaining it on write paths raised get and put latency, which implies stash buckets are rarely empty here.
- Latency claims are again unreliable. v002's put regression is outside what its get-path change can explain, and v003's per-op gain is larger than a victim-only change would normally account for.

## Open questions

- Is v001's hit-rate loss stable across traces, and does the loss come only from full buckets?
- Why does v002 count as a Winner given its recorded get and put latency regressions? The Winner basis is not visible in the insight.
- Does v003's hit-rate gain hold on workloads other than workload-a?
- Is v003's per-op improvement real, or noise like the unexplained movements in cycle 0001?

## Continuation

Next cycle should pursue frequency-aware victim selection (v003's direction) and check it across more than one workload before building on it. Drop insert-position gating on fullness (v001) and stash occupancy fast paths (v002) unless new evidence shows empty stash buckets are common. Treat any per-op latency gain as unconfirmed until it is re-measured.
