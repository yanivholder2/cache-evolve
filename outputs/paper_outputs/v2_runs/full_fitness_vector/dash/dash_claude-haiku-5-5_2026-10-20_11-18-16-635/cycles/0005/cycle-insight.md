# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort tried to narrow or cheapen the frequency-aware victim selection from cycle 0004: a two-choice sampled victim search (v001), the same counter restricted to stash-bucket victims on top of the deferred promotion (v002), and a record repack that was meant to shrink the segment (v003). None of the three reproduces cycle 0004's hit-rate gain, and the repack did not change the segment size it was meant to change. All three are labelled Winners, but each records a hit-rate or per-op regression.

## Patterns

- Narrowing the frequency-aware victim choice gave back its gain. Sampling two slots instead of scanning the bucket (v001) and restricting the counter to stash victims (v002) both left hit rate below the full-scan version from cycle 0004, so the retention effect depends on seeing the true lowest-counter resident.
- Cutting the victim search short did not make puts cheaper. v001's two-choice search raised put latency rather than bringing it toward the parent's level, which suggests scan length was not the main put-path cost. This partly answers cycle 0004's open question about put-side cost; the cost source is still unidentified.
- The frequency signal is not a cheap add-on to the deferred promotion. Stacking the counter on stash victims (v002) hurt both hit rate and both get and put tails, so the cycle 0004 combination with v001's promotion is not safe to extend without re-measurement.
- The repack did not land (v003). Segment and metadata size are unchanged, and hit rate is identical to the parent. Cycle 0004's per-op gain from the same layout idea therefore still has no mechanism behind it, and the size-reduction explanation offered there is not supported.
- Per-op movements remain unexplained. Get and put tails move in both directions across the cohort, and the attributions given are inferred rather than confirmed in source. This is the same pattern flagged in cycles 0001 to 0004.
- Every hit-rate signal again comes from workload-a. The second-trace checks requested in cycles 0003 and 0004 were not run here.

## Open questions

- Does full-scan lowest-counter eviction (cycle 0004 v002) keep its hit-rate gain on a second trace, and how much of its put cost is the scan itself?
- Is there a cheaper way to find the lowest-counter resident that keeps the full-scan ranking, such as maintaining the minimum incrementally?
- Why are all three variants Winners given their recorded regressions? The Winner basis is still not visible in the insights.
- Does the cycle 0004 per-op gain from the repack survive a layout change that actually reduces segment size?

## Continuation

Next cycle should go back to full-scan frequency-aware eviction from cycle 0004 (v002) rather than sampled or stash-only variants, and test it on a second, non-workload-a trace; focus on a cheaper way to find the victim. Keep the deferred promotion as the base. Drop the two-choice sampling (v001) and stash-only restriction (v002). Do not build on the repack (v003) until a variant verifiably shrinks the segment, and do not credit any per-op gain from this cohort until it is re-measured.
