# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants branched from cycle-4 v001 and used spare capacity in different ways. v001 added the two-choice stash but probes `s1` last. v002 combined the two-choice stash with normal-tier victim rescue. v003 puts fresh items into free target slots at insert time. All three raised hit-rate over the parent, and v002 confirmed that cycle 4's two levers stack. Only v001 met its latency claim, and only relative to cycle-4 v002. Every variant is still slower than the parent on get, and v003's latency claim was refuted.

## Patterns

- Using idle capacity is still the only lever that raises hit-rate. Every variant that keeps items in neighbour stash buckets or normal-bucket holes gains. Metadata-size stayed flat in all of them. The neighbour-stash and rescue levers draw on different capacity, so their gains add up. v002 can't tell how much each one contributes.
- The cost of extra residency shows up in latency, and the lookup order decides who pays it. Scanning `s1` before the normal tiers charges every target and probing hit. Scanning it last (v001) charges only misses and the rare `s1` hits, with no change in cache state. The reorder is state-neutral because a key lives in at most one slot, and v001's exact hit-rate match confirms this. The same argument should carry over to the rescue structure.
- When an item fills a hole matters. Filling holes late (rescuing stash victims) costs nothing on lookup. Filling them early (fresh puts into target) fills the normal tier with cold items. Later reuse-proven promotions then pay for eviction and demotion cascades that used to be free inserts. The cost moves to promotions instead of going away.
- The get-latency gap that remains on the two-choice structure comes from misses scanning one more bucket. Further reordering can't close it, because `s1` is already last.

## Open questions

- Does v001's `s0 → target → probing → s1` order on top of v002's two-choice + rescue placement keep v002's hit-rate exactly and recover its get-p50 cost? It should, but this hasn't been verified.
- Can most `s1` probes on misses be skipped cheaply? One option is a per-`s0` "has overflowed" bit, another is a fingerprint. What does that do to metadata-size?
- Does fresh-into-target-hole add anything on top of rescue, given they compete for the same holes? Could fresh items be placed so they always give way to promoted items, without competing at the target's LRU end?

## Continuation

Make v002's placement (two-choice stash + rescue) the new parent, combined with v001's lookup order that probes `s1` last. Check that hit-rate is unchanged and get p50 improves. Next, go after the remaining get cost on misses with a cheap `s1` skip filter, and judge any metadata cost against the latency gain. Set aside v003's eager fresh-into-target fill: it trades latency for hit-rate in a way rescue already covers more cheaply. Revisit it only in a form that never blocks later promotions.
