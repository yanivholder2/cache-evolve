# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three latency-only variants on the minimal bit-packed second-hit filter: deleting more write-only bookkeeping (v001), skipping promotion on a flagged hit (v002), and hoisting hash/index/tag computation out of the locked region (v003). All were Winners because hit-rate and metadata stayed flat. None delivered a convincing latency gain. v001 was at the noise floor, and v002 and v003 made median latency slightly worse.

## Patterns

- Hit-rate and metadata were invariant in every variant, as designed. These variants only changed mechanics, so they say nothing new about policy.
- Subtractive changes ran out of room. The remaining dead stores are too few to measurably help, so the cycle 0004 "subtract only" direction looks exhausted.
- Restructuring the hot path (skipping promotion, hoisting arithmetic out of the lock) again made latency slightly worse. This is the fourth cycle in a row where a hot-path edit to the incumbent did not pay off.
- Regressions again appeared on paths the change did not touch, and tail movements went in both directions. Noise or code layout is the likeliest explanation, and the noise floor has never been measured.
- Second-hit promotion and hash arithmetic are not where hit-path time goes.

## Open questions

- What is the run-to-run noise floor for get and put latency on the unchanged incumbent?
- Where do get and put time actually go (lock acquisition, bucket scan, memory access)? Nothing has profiled this yet.
- Does a different trace, such as one with scans or frequency skew, reveal differences these levers cannot show on the LIRS trace?

## Continuation

Stop editing the hot path blind. Drop further dead-store deletion, promotion-skip and hoisting variants. The next cycle should first establish the noise floor by repeating baseline runs, and profile where get and put time goes. Alternatively, it should evaluate the incumbent on a different trace. Only try structural changes to probing, bucket layout or locking if profiling points to them.
