# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle pursued three orthogonal levers beyond sketch geometry: hash function quality (v002), and two variants of frequency-aware eviction policy (v001, v003). **v001 and v003 advanced as winners, but both came with severe tail-latency costs.** v002, targeting hash function decorrelation, regressed on both hit-rate and latency, revealing that collision reduction is not a limiting factor on this workload. The cohort demonstrates that eviction policy optimization is possible but fragile—hit-rate gains are modest and come at high latency variance costs.

## Patterns

- **Eviction policy improvements trade latency variance for accuracy**: v001 improved hit-rate by ~0.3% through frequency-aware victim selection in a 5-item candidate pool, but introduced +96% tail latency (p99) on put operations. v003 achieved a marginal +0.068% hit-rate gain using median-frequency victim filtering, but paid a catastrophic 364× p99 latency spike. Both variants validate that breaking strict LRU order in favor of frequency signals improves hit-rate, but the scanning/computation overhead during eviction creates latency variance. The baseline's O(1) LRU simplicity purchases latency predictability; frequency-aware selection costs consistency.

- **Hash function quality does not correlate with hit-rate on this workload**: v002's XOR-combined hashing strategy—a standard technique for decorrelating count-min sketch rows—provided no hit-rate improvement and imposed substantial latency cost (36% on get, 27% on put). This suggests the baseline's single `DefaultHasher` with simple seed variation already produces sufficiently independent collisions for this workload, or that collisions are not the primary bottleneck to accuracy. The result contradicts the hypothesis that better hash functions would reduce collision-induced estimation errors.

- **Scaling sensitivity reveals the eviction path is the new bottleneck**: v001's O(1) scanning overhead (5-item pool) is linear in eviction frequency and proportional to cache operations; v003's O(n) median computation and linear victim search saturates at smaller operation volumes. Both exhibit qualitatively different failure modes (v001's gradual degradation vs. v003's catastrophic spike), indicating the eviction code path does not tolerate algorithmic complexity. This marks a shift: prior cycles optimized sketch geometry (collisions); this cycle reveals eviction policy has become the performance constraint.

- **Winners came with liabilities**: Despite advancing, v001 and v003 both exhibit tradeoffs that may not be favorable for latency-critical systems. v001's +0.3% hit-rate gain is offset by +96% tail latency; v003's marginal gain is catastrophically expensive. The "winner" status may reflect hit-rate metrics only, masking latency regressions that would disqualify these variants in production.

## Open questions

- Can v001's frequency-aware selection be tuned to smaller pool sizes (N=2 or 3) to reduce latency variance while retaining most of the hit-rate gain?
- Why did hash function quality not matter? Is the baseline's single seeded DefaultHasher already achieving adequate independence, or does the workload happen to have favorable collision patterns?
- Are the hit-rate improvements from v001 and v003 large enough to justify their latency costs in a latency-critical system? Is there a metric or workload context where these tradeoffs flip?

## Continuation

**Investigate frequency-aware eviction at reduced cost**: v001 proved the concept but at high latency variance. Explore smaller pool sizes (N=2 or 3) on the next cycle to bracket the cost-benefit frontier. **Discard hash function optimization entirely**—v002's failure suggests decorrelation is not a bottleneck. **Reassess whether hit-rate gains are worth latency costs**: if the system prioritizes latency predictability, the strict LRU baseline may be preferable despite lower hit-rate. **Profile the eviction path bottleneck**: determine whether p99 spikes are due to scanning cost, frequency estimation overhead, or something else, then optimize the specific bottleneck rather than changing the policy wholesale. If eviction policy optimization is abandoned, shift focus to orthogonal levers outside the cache internals (e.g., workload-dependent parameter scheduling, admission policy micro-tuning with decay, or cache size variations).
