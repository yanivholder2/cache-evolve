# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cycle probed three distinct levers — SLRU split-ratio tightening, sketch-aging at a much longer cadence, and a frequency-gated promotion threshold — against the SLRU baseline inherited from cycle 0001. Only the 90/10 split variant won, and only by a negligible margin; the other two produced no improvement or a slight regression.

## Patterns

- **SLRU ratio tuning has reached diminishing returns.** Moving from 80/20 to 90/10 barely moved the needle, confirming that the hot set was already well-contained in the protected segment at 80 %; the extra headroom covers only marginal-frequency items. The shrinkage of the probationary buffer caused no visible harm, reinforcing that probationary is a pass-through staging area on this workload, not a competitive contention zone.
- **Sketch aging is consistently harmful regardless of cadence.** Even at 10× the already-conservative reset interval tested in cycle 0001, periodic halving of counters erodes frequency signal more than it cleans up stale counts. The frequency distribution on this trace is stable across the entire replay window; accumulated counts are signal, not noise.
- **The promotion threshold landed in a behavioral dead zone.** At a threshold of 2, too few borderline items were affected — either they are too rare to matter or they accumulate frequency fast enough to qualify for promotion shortly after anyway. The concept is sound but the threshold value was ineffective at this workload's access rate.
- **All three axes hit a wall together.** None of the three hypotheses produced a meaningful gain, suggesting the SLRU-on-TinyLFU configuration is near a local optimum for workload-a at this cache size, and parameter-level tuning within the current structure is largely exhausted.

## Open questions

- Is there a promotion threshold high enough (e.g., 5–10) to actually reduce protected-segment churn, or does this trace simply not produce enough borderline-frequency contention for the gate to matter?
- What structural changes — beyond SLRU segmentation and sketch aging — could shift hit rate on a stable Zipfian workload? Candidates include ghost/victim caches, adaptive admission biases, or size-aware eviction.
- Is the admission frequency gate itself the tightest bottleneck, or is eviction ordering (within protected) the remaining lever?

## Continuation

SLRU split-ratio tuning and sketch aging are both exhausted as levers for this workload and should be deprioritized in future hypotheses. The next cycle should leave the 90/10 split in place (as the marginal winner) and pivot to structural rather than parametric changes: consider ghost-cache admission feedback (tracking recently evicted keys to bias re-admission), or probing whether the in-segment LRU ordering within protected could be replaced by a frequency-ordered variant. The promotion threshold concept is worth one more test at a substantially higher value, but should not consume a dedicated variant slot unless paired with a complementary change.
