# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cohort tested the generalizability of cache-line alignment and early-exit optimization, techniques that succeeded on 32×64 geometry in cycle 0004. Three variants applied these micro-optimizations to three different bucket geometries: baseline 128×16, parent 64×32, and ultra-wide 16×128. All three variants failed to improve fitness. Geometry-specific optimizations do not transfer across bucket configurations—a critical finding that challenges the assumption that micro-optimization is a general tool for latency control.

## Patterns

- **Micro-optimizations are geometry-sensitive, not universal**: v004/v003's success with early-exit and cache-line alignment on 32×64 was taken as a general principle in cycle 0005, but the results show it does not generalize. v001's application to baseline 128×16 actually *hurt* latency (get p50 +45%, p99 doubled), while v002's application to 64×32 produced no measurable gain. This reveals that the micro-optimization strategy was finely tuned to the specific bucket scan profile of 32×64, not a reusable optimization principle.

- **Micro-optimization saturates and inverts at geometric extremes**: v003's extension to ultra-wide 16×128 exposed the scalability limits. Early-exit and cache-line alignment were engineered to manage the cost of scanning ~30-item buckets, but cannot contain the cost of 128-item sequential searches. Put operations degraded 3×, get p99 doubled, and hit-rate declined due to tighter bucket distribution. The micro-optimization strategy inverts when bucket size exceeds its design threshold.

- **Compiler sophistication narrows the opportunity window**: v002's null result (no change in fitness despite adding manual optimizations to 64×32) suggests the Rust compiler is already applying equivalent optimizations at the assembly level or the workload pattern doesn't trigger scenarios where these hand-coded techniques provide measurable advantage. This pattern echoes cycle 0004's observation about modern CPUs: the margin for manual micro-optimization is shrinking.

- **Previous cycle's tentative winner may be a narrow local optimum**: Cycle 0004 positioned 32×64 with micro-ops as a turning point—the first variant to decouple latency from geometry. Cycle 0005's failure to generalize these optimizations suggests that v004/v003 was optimized specifically for that geometry and workload, not a foundation for further progress. The apparent "win" may not extend to other workload distributions, cache sizes, or access patterns.

## Open questions

- Is 32×64 with micro-ops truly superior to baseline 128×16 in fitness, or was cycle 0004's assessment overstated? Does this variant hold up under different workload distributions?
- Why does early-exit work on 32×64 but hurt on 128×16? Is the difference rooted in absolute bucket size, the interplay between hash-table lookups and intra-bucket scans, or cache-line occupancy patterns?
- Have we reached a fundamental limit where geometry and micro-optimization can no longer yield progress, requiring a return to policy or algorithmic innovation?
- Is the 32×64 point a true Pareto frontier, or a local optimum that becomes suboptimal under broader conditions?

## Continuation

Micro-optimization has reached a ceiling in this cycle—early-exit and cache-line alignment do not generalize across geometries and may have been over-fitted to 32×64. The cohort reveals that implementation-level tuning, while valuable for specific configurations, is not a scalable lever for overall fitness improvement. The next cycle should: (1) empirically re-evaluate whether 32×64 with micro-ops is truly a fitness win relative to baseline and prior cycles across multiple workload distributions before committing further optimization effort, (2) if micro-optimization is confirmed as locally optimal but not generalizable, return to orthogonal approaches—policy innovations designed for high-occupancy buckets, learned or adaptive placement strategies, or multi-core efficiency—rather than further geometric or implementation tuning, or (3) if micro-optimization is abandoned, consider broader architectural changes such as cache-oblivious designs or data structures (e.g., cuckoo hashing, learned indices) that might break the current geometry-latency trade-off entirely.
