## Prior cycles digest

### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort probed three orthogonal directions off the cycle-2 baselines: isolating ghost admission's marginal contribution, rescuing frequency-aware demotion with a larger scan window and persistent counters, and testing a second-chance reprieve bit in the protected segment. Only the repaired frequency-demotion variant (v002) won, delivering a meaningful hit-rate gain by scanning the LRU quarter of protected and halving rather than resetting counters on demotion.

## Patterns

- Ghost admission is now confirmed as minimally effective on this workload. When grafted cleanly onto the cycle-1 SLRU baseline, it produced negligible lift, resolving cycle-2's ambiguity: the earlier gain attributed to ghost admission was almost entirely SLRU segmentation doing the work. The ghost window (bounded to the probationary capacity) is too narrow to intercept the reuse gap typical of this trace.
- Cycle-2's frequency-demotion failure was entirely a design flaw, not a fundamental ceiling. Scaling the scan window to a fixed fraction of the protected segment — rather than a constant small count — creates genuine selection pressure. Counter halving on demotion is the necessary complement: it lets accumulated history survive segment transitions so newly promoted nodes remain distinguishable from long-tenured ones.
- The second-chance bit failed because it required freezing node position on protected hits, which severed the continuous recency signal that makes LRU ordering useful. A one-time reprieve cannot substitute for a move-to-tail on every access; the hot entries it was meant to protect end up stranded near the demotion head anyway.
- Continuous position updates on protected hits are load-bearing. Any mechanism that suppresses them — regardless of its reprieve logic — degrades the protected segment's ordering and should not be adopted unless the position-signal loss is compensated elsewhere.

## Open questions

- Can frequency-aware demotion (v002) coexist with ghost admission without noise? Given ghost admission's negligible effect on workload-a, the combination is likely neutral, but the interaction has not been tested directly.
- Is the LRU-quarter scan fraction robust across workload shapes, or does the right window size vary with the reuse distance distribution? A workload with longer reuse distances might need a wider scan.
- Could a second-chance approach be salvaged by setting the referenced bit while still performing the move-to-tail (preserving recency ordering)? The current failure was the position-freeze trade-off, not the reprieve concept itself.

## Continuation

Next cycle should take v002 as the new baseline: two-segment SLRU with ghost admission, frequency-aware demotion scanning the LRU quarter of protected, and counter halving on demotion. Ghost admission can be deprioritized — it has been tested in isolation and found to contribute little on this workload. A productive direction is to explore whether the scan fraction (currently one quarter) should be adaptive or tuned, and whether combining frequency-aware demotion with a significantly larger ghost window (e.g., equal to total capacity rather than probationary capacity) can make cross-residency warmth visible enough to matter.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants extended the cycle-3 frequency-demotion baseline in different directions — scan-fraction widening, ghost-window expansion, and frequency-aware eviction in probationary. Only the probationary extension (v003) won, by ensuring that the freq counter preserved across demotion actively shields recently-warm entries at both eviction sites.

## Patterns

- The frequency counter and counter-halving-on-demotion design have been the load-bearing mechanism since cycle 3, but it was applied asymmetrically: protected-segment demotion respected frequency, while probationary eviction discarded it via blind LRU. v003 closed that gap — the signal survived the segment boundary but was being thrown away at the next eviction decision.
- Scan-fraction tuning above 1/4 in the protected segment is now confirmed to offer negligible returns on this workload. Going from 1/4 to 1/3 moved hit rate only marginally, indicating the frequency variation near the LRU end of protected is mostly captured by the narrower window already.
- Ghost-window expansion to full capacity regressed hit rate: reuse events at distances between probationary capacity and total capacity on this trace are not reliable locality signals, and fast-pathing those keys into protected pollutes it. The effective ceiling for the ghost window sits well below total capacity, and the ghost-window expansion thread is now largely exhausted.

## Open questions

- Is the probationary LRU-half scan fraction robust, or should it be adaptive? A workload with longer reuse distances or a more skewed access distribution might need a different fraction at the probationary eviction site.
- With frequency awareness now applied at both eviction sites, is there any remaining structural gap, or have the major policy improvements been captured? A direct comparison against a wider workload suite would clarify how general these gains are.
- Could an intermediate ghost window (e.g., 50% of total capacity, between probationary capacity and the failed full expansion) recover some cross-residency signal without the admission-quality problem seen at full capacity?

## Continuation

Next cycle should take v003 as the new baseline: two-segment SLRU, counter-halving demotion, frequency-aware eviction scanning the LRU quarter of protected and the LRU half of probationary. Ghost-window expansion can be deprioritized — the full-ceiling test failed and intermediate values are unlikely to move the needle meaningfully on this trace. The most productive direction is probing the probationary scan fraction (is 1/2 near optimal, or does a smaller fraction suffice?), and testing whether either or both scan fractions should vary proportionally with observed reuse-distance patterns rather than being fixed.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants probed the cycle-4 frequency-aware baseline from different angles — scan-fraction narrowing, counter inflation control, and admission gating — and none produced a hit-rate gain. The winner (v002) advanced on neutrality: the frequency cap introduced no regression while the other two variants hurt performance, making it the best performer in a cohort that collectively confirmed the current configuration is near a local optimum on this workload.

## Patterns

- The probationary half-scan is now confirmed as genuinely necessary, not merely conservative. Frequency variation among probationary entries — cold newcomers mixed with demoted entries carrying halved counters spanning a wider range — is spread throughout the list, not compressed near the LRU head. The quarter-scan that suffices for protected (where all entries have at least one access and frequency variation near the LRU end is compressed) does not transfer to probationary.
- Counter inflation is not an active problem on this workload. The halving-on-demotion mechanism already prevents runaway accumulation in practice: entries must remain in protected without ever being demoted for counters to inflate far above the cap, and that residency pattern does not occur at this cache size on workload-a. The MAX_FREQ=8 cap is structurally sound as a guardrail but targets a pathology the trace does not exhibit.
- The frequency-aware eviction scan introduced in cycle 4 already provides sufficient cold-traffic filtering in probationary. A two-hit promotion gate is redundant protection — the entries that survive in probationary are generally worth promoting immediately, and the extra exposure window costs more hot-key residency than the one-hit-wonder reduction saves.
- Two consecutive cohorts (cycles 4 and 5) have produced wins that are structural closures rather than fresh gains: cycle 4 closed the asymmetry between eviction sites; cycle 5 confirmed that three further refinements of the resulting design produce no improvement. This is a convergence signal for the current policy on this workload.

## Open questions

- Is the policy now at a local optimum for workload-a, or are there unexplored structural directions (e.g., adaptive scan fractions tied to observed hit-rate feedback, segment-ratio tuning, or load-sensitive demotion) that could break out of the current plateau?
- Would the frequency cap (v002's change) matter on a workload with longer-lived hotspots where continuous protected residency without demotion is more common?
- Is widening the evaluation to a second workload the most informative next step — to distinguish genuine convergence from workload-specific saturation?

## Continuation

Next cycle should carry v002 forward as the new baseline (the MAX_FREQ=8 cap is a harmless guardrail worth keeping). The probationary half-scan and immediate single-hit promotion are both settled — neither narrowing the scan nor adding a promotion gate is productive on this workload. With three scan-fraction and admission variants now exhausted, the highest-value direction is either a genuinely new structural axis (adaptive policy parameters, segment-ratio exploration beyond the previously tested range, or a different eviction philosophy) or explicit multi-workload evaluation to determine whether the policy has converged broadly or only on workload-a.
