### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three variants refined eviction victim-selection scoring formulas to balance frequency and recency in the decision of which cached item to evict. The simple linear hybrid (v001: age / (frequency + 1)) won by a narrow margin; a sqrt-dampened variant (v002) showed modest improvement; normalization by relative frequency (v003) degraded performance. The cohort confirms that the eviction layer is the active tuning axis and that straightforward hybrid formulas outperform complex normalizations.

## Patterns

- **Linear frequency weighting is still optimal for this workload**: v001's straightforward score of age / (frequency + 1) outperformed v002's sqrt-dampened variant (age / (sqrt(frequency) + 1)), despite v002's hypothesis that sub-linear scaling would better balance age and frequency. This suggests the workload's frequency distribution is steep enough that linear scaling captures the hot/cold boundary more accurately than damped scaling.

- **Simplicity beats normalized complexity**: v003's relative-frequency normalization (age / (1 + freq/max_freq)) failed despite addressing a plausible problem—helping identify items much colder than the working set. The added complexity of computing max_frequency and normalizing each item's frequency appears to introduce noise rather than sharpen discrimination. The simple linear hybrid (v001) remains more robust.

- **Frequency-recency hybrids consistently improve over pure-LRU baselines**: Both v001 and v002 delivered measurable hits through the same conceptual lens—incorporating both temporal recency (age) and observed frequency into victim selection. This validates Cycle 0003's pivot away from sketch tuning and toward cache-policy optimization.

- **Eviction-layer tuning is now sensitive to formula details**: The three variants employed nearly identical approaches (age divided by some frequency term), yet their outcomes diverged based on the specific formula. This indicates that the eviction-selection metric is now the active lever for improvement, and small changes in how frequency is weighted have measurable impact.

## Open questions

- Why does the linear formula (v001) outperform sub-linear damping (v002)? Is the workload's frequency distribution such that high-frequency items are genuinely rare, making damping unnecessary?
- Can the winning formula be further tuned with different constants (e.g., age^α / (frequency^β + 1)) to extract additional gains?
- Are other signals beyond frequency and age—item size, reuse distance, contention—worth incorporating into the victim-selection metric?
- How stable is v001's improvement across different workloads, cache sizes, or access patterns?

## Continuation

The eviction victim-selection approach from Cycle 0003 is productive and generalizable. v001's straightforward linear hybrid won over both sub-linear damping and normalization, validating that simplicity and directness remain advantageous. For the next cycle, focus on tuning the winning formula itself: explore different exponents and offsets within the age / (frequency + 1) framework, test across varied workloads, and measure whether introducing orthogonal signals (size, cost, reuse distance) yields additive gains. Avoid complex normalizations or domain-specific tricks—the pattern suggests the cache benefits from interpretable, transparent metrics. The admission gate and sketch parameters remain stable; the frontier is now fine-tuning the hybrid eviction metric.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle attempted to refine the eviction victim-selection formula through parameter tuning and signal ablation. Three variants tested increasing the frequency offset constant, applying super-linear age weighting, and eliminating age entirely in favor of pure frequency-based selection. None of the refinements improved hit-rate; the unchanged baseline (v001) won by virtue of producing no regression.

## Patterns

- **The linear hybrid formula has reached a local optimum**: Both parameter refinements (H01's increased offset and H02's super-linear age weighting) produced zero measurable change in hit-rate. The current formula—age / (frequency + 1)—appears to be well-tuned for this workload's characteristics, and simple constant tweaking and exponent adjustments no longer yield gains. This represents a qualitative shift from Cycles 0003–0004, where policy-level changes and formula innovations still delivered improvements.

- **Recency remains essential and cannot be substituted with frequency alone**: v003's removal of age signal caused a 0.31% hit-rate loss despite the improved sketch precision from prior cycles. This definitively shows that temporal locality and frequency capture orthogonal aspects of working-set membership. The hypothesis that sufficiently precise frequency estimates might eliminate the need for age has been falsified; the two signals are complementary, not redundant.

- **Fine-tuning the frequency-recency surface exhibits diminishing returns**: Cycles 0003–0004 showed that switching from pure-LRU to hybrid scoring and then optimizing the linear formula were productive. Cycle 0005's inability to improve through constant and exponent adjustments suggests the high-level structure is sound, but further local refinement has exhausted low-hanging fruit.

- **Simplicity continues to outperform elaboration**: The unchanged v001 baseline beat both attempts to refine it, reinforcing the pattern from prior cycles that straightforward, interpretable metrics (linear hybrid scoring) are more robust than parameterized fine-tuning or structural variation.

## Open questions

- Have we exhausted the victim-selection metric itself, or are there fundamentally different scoring approaches (e.g., probabilistic, rank-based, or information-theoretic) worth exploring?
- Are other cache levers now the constraint: admission gate strictness, sketch parameter interaction, or item-level metadata (size, cost)?
- Would introducing orthogonal signals—item size, reuse distance, or inter-arrival time—unlock new gains, or are they already implicitly captured by age and frequency?
- Does performance plateau differently on other workloads, or is this plateau workload-specific?

## Continuation

The victim-selection metric has plateaued under local parameter tuning. The linear frequency-age hybrid remains sound and should be retained as the eviction policy baseline. Do not pursue further formula refinement (exponents, offsets, normalization) on this or similar workloads unless new signals are incorporated. Consider pivoting to orthogonal cache levers: test whether admission gate logic (strict > admission) or sketch parameters need re-tuning in light of this stable eviction policy, or explore whether metadata-driven signals (item size, cost, access pattern clustering) add discriminative power beyond frequency and age. The eviction-selection frontier is now either about broadening the signal set or shifting focus entirely to other parts of the cache system.


### Cycle 0006

# Cycle 0006 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle tested whether the refined eviction policy (age / frequency hybrid from prior cycles) enabled relaxations to the admission gate, or whether integrating orthogonal signals (item size, time-dependent terms) into either policy layer could unlock improvements. All three variants regressed: gate relaxation reduced selectivity, size penalties conflicted with frequency signals, and time-based admission logic became unbounded and ungrounded. The cohort confirms that the strict admission threshold and pure frequency-age eviction form a stable, locked optimum.

## Patterns

- **The strict admission gate `>` is optimal and not an artifact of prior eviction policies**: v001 retested gate relaxation (>=) under the current refined victim-selection policy and confirmed hit-rate regression. This shows the gate's strictness is not a limitation of simpler eviction logic, but a necessary discriminator. Items with equal frequency to the victim should remain rejected; this distinction cannot be compensated by improved eviction decisions downstream.

- **Size and frequency-age operate on incompatible optimization axes**: v002's attempt to incorporate item size as a multiplicative penalty showed that size-based optimization directly conflicts with frequency preservation. When a small item is hot and a large item is cold, the size penalty overrides frequency and causes incorrect evictions. This reveals that size cannot be seamlessly combined with the frequency-recency signal; any size-based optimization must be structurally decoupled or subordinate to frequency.

- **Admission and eviction are fundamentally different problems with different signal models**: v003 exposed that what works for eviction (age / frequency hybrid) cannot be directly mirrored in admission. The time-based admission gate failed because absolute elapsed time lacks grounding—it grows unbounded regardless of incoming item value. Eviction scores items already cached (with measured access history), while admission must score items arriving from external requests (with unknowable future utility). These require different signal architectures.

- **The incumbent policy is stable against targeted relaxations**: Both admission-layer modifications (v001, v003) and the eviction-layer augmentation (v002) failed without exception. The baseline eviction policy and strict gate form a tightly coupled, locally optimal system. Further improvement requires either orthogonal signals properly grounded to item properties, or a shift away from the current policy framework altogether.

## Open questions

- Have we exhausted the admission layer entirely, or are there signals other than frequency (e.g., item request pattern, inter-arrival time, cost-per-byte) that could improve gate discrimination?
- Should size be addressed as a separate optimization (e.g., size-aware replacement cost, item clustering by size), rather than folded into victim scoring?
- Is the cache approaching an asymptotic hit-rate ceiling under this workload with the current policy structure, or does a fundamentally different eviction or admission architecture exist?
- Do the failures in this cycle reflect workload-specific constraints, or are admission-gate strictness and frequency-age eviction universally robust?

## Continuation

The admission gate and eviction policies are now locked. The strict `>` threshold and age / frequency hybrid form a stable optimum; do not revisit gate relaxation or frequency-recency hybridization in admission without new, properly grounded signals. Size optimization failed when combined with frequency; if byte-efficiency matters, pursue it as an independent lever (e.g., size-clustering, cost-aware replacement) or accept that hit-rate and size-efficiency may be trading axes on this workload. The next cycle should either explore fundamentally different signals (cost, pattern clustering, access burstiness) for admission or eviction, or broaden the test matrix to other workloads and cache configurations to determine whether the current plateau is local or global.
