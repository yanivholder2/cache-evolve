### Cycle 0001

# Cycle 0001 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants branched from baseline, each aimed at a different axis: SLRU for hit rate (v001), CLOCK lazy promotion for get latency (v002), and `u32` link compaction for metadata size (v003). Both Winners (v002, v003) shrank node metadata. v001 improved hit rate, but paid for it with larger nodes and slower operations.

## Patterns

- Shrinking metadata was the most reliable win. Two different routes got there: dropping the links entirely (v002) and narrowing them (v003). The node layout has no free padding, so any added field costs a full word unless it reuses space the node already has. v001's prediction that padding would absorb its new byte was wrong.
- get latency hardly moves whatever the list does. Removing relinking (v002) and compacting nodes (v003) both left get p50 roughly flat. This points to the `HashMap` probe, not list maintenance, as the dominant cost of a hit.
- Frequency or scan filtering gives modest hit-rate gains on the MSR block traces. The gains depend on cache size. SLRU helped mostly at the large size, while CLOCK's single bit helped hm_0 at both sizes and web_0 at the small size, and lost slightly on web_0 at the large size. Neither approach dominated.
- Policy changes moved several axes at once, with mixed results. Representation-only changes (v003) moved one axis cleanly and left hit rate exactly unchanged.

## Open questions

- Can SLRU's frequency filter run on a compact node (a segment flag in a link high bit or sentinel, on top of `u32` indices) without the metadata and latency penalty?
- Would an adaptive or larger probation share fix SLRU's weakness at the small cache size?
- Can CLOCK's put tail latency be bounded, for example with a capped sweep or amortised hand advance, without losing its median gain?
- Would a faster hasher or a different map layout finally move get p50?

## Continuation

Treat v003's `u32`-index layout as the default base for later variants. It is policy-neutral and costs nothing. Combine it with scan resistance: try SLRU with an in-node flag and/or a tuned probation share, or CLOCK with a bounded sweep. To lower get latency, target the hash map. Drop further list or node-compaction ideas as a speed lever.


### Cycle 0002

# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Every variant was a follow-up to a cycle-0001 open question. v001 swapped the hasher on CLOCK, v002 added a GCLOCK counter in CLOCK's padding byte, and v003 ported SLRU onto the `u32` node with an in-link flag. All three are Winners, but only v003 got a clear gain without a matching cost. It kept SLRU's full hit-rate benefit on a compact node, and its remaining price is confined to put.

## Patterns

- Folding policy state into existing bits now works. A segment flag in a link's high bit (v003) and a counter in the padding byte (v002) both kept the node at its compact size. So the metadata objection to frequency- or scan-aware policies is settled. What's left to fix is latency.
- Hit-rate gains came with put-path costs in both policy variants. In SLRU the cost is the promote/demote double relink plus branching per segment. In GCLOCK it is sweep length multiplied by decrement-by-one aging. Neither added meaningful cost to get p50, so the work is in the put/eviction path, not the hit path.
- SLRU beat GCLOCK on hit rate: it improved every trace at both sizes, while GCLOCK's gain was mostly hm_0 at the large size. Neither variant fixed web_0 at the large size, so plain frequency counting is not what that trace needs.
- The hash-map lever failed again, and this time get got worse. Making the hash cheaper doesn't help. The probe appears to be bound by memory and sensitive to hash distribution on structured block keys. This is inferred, since probe lengths aren't measured.

## Open questions

- Can SLRU's put cost be cut? For example, avoid the second relink on promotion, give puts to existing keys a cheaper path, or remove the per-segment head/tail branching.
- Was GCLOCK's get slowdown real, or an artifact of the long put sweeps interleaved with gets in the benchmark?
- Would a denser or smaller table, such as narrower values or a better-mixing finaliser, move get latency where a cheaper hash did not?
- What does web_0 at the large size need, given that neither recency segmentation nor small counters fixed it? Possibly ghost/history entries or an adaptive split.

## Continuation

Make v003's flag-packed SLRU on `u32` nodes the default base, and next try to cut its put-path cost: cheaper promotion/demotion and a fast path for updating existing keys. Drop cheaper-hash ideas. Drop GCLOCK with decrement-by-one aging unless aging is moved off the eviction path, for example by bulk halving. If you go after get latency, try table density or hash quality, not hash speed.
