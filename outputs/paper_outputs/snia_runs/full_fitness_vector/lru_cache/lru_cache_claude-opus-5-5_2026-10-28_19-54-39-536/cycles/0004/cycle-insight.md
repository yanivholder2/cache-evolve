# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants branched from cycle-0002 v003 (flag-packed SLRU on `u32` nodes). v001 tried an adaptive protected/probation split, v002 a single-`Entry` put path with no key clone, and v003 a gentle fingerprint-ghost second chance inside probation. The Winners are v002 and v003. v002 is the only clean gain: put got faster with policy and layout unchanged. v003 is the first history mechanism that helped web_0 instead of hurting it, though the net hit-rate gain is small and get latency regressed.

## Patterns

- Cutting hash operations on put works. v002 bears out the cycle-0003 finding that put cost tracks hash count. It is the first latency lever across four cycles that moved its target without hurting hit rate or metadata.
- Gentle admission solves web_0's sensitivity. A one-shot reprieve that stays in probation lifted web_0 at both sizes, which reverses the damage cycle 3's ghost and gate did. Its benefit is size-dependent, though: hm_0 gained at the small size and lost slightly at the large size.
- Small per-cache hit-rate effects are hidden by noise. v001's one-epoch hill-climber kept chasing workload swings and lost on hm_0. Its only win was web_0 at the small size, which again suggests probation is undersized there.
- Any extra work on the hit path is very costly for get. v001's per-op tick and v003's masking of `next` both raised get p50 sharply. Header growth past one cache line and heap side arrays probably add to this. Both policy variants also grew the `LruCache` header. Repeated across cycles, the rule is that the `on_hit` link path and the header's hot cache line must stay untouched.
- v002's get p99 rose although its get code was identical. This may be noise, or the insert-before-remove order may be changing the hash table's internal state. It is unresolved.

## Open questions

- Is v002's get-p99 rise real? If so, would removing before inserting (so the new key reuses the freed slot) keep the put gain without the tail?
- Can v003's second-chance bit live somewhere that is free on the hit path, such as a padding byte or the key/value side rather than `next`, so get p50 recovers?
- Should the reprieve be gated by cache size, applying only when probation is small relative to the working set, so it stops costing hm_0 at the large size?
- Would a static per-size retune of the probation share capture v001's web_0 small-size gain with no runtime cost?

## Continuation

Use v002's single-`Entry`, no-clone put as the new default base. Re-check its get p99, and if it is real, try remove-before-insert. If you pursue hit rate, port v003's probation-only reprieve onto that base, with the flag stored off the `next` link and the header kept within one cache line, and consider scaling it by cache size. Drop online hill-climbing of the SLRU split. Try a static per-size probation share instead.
