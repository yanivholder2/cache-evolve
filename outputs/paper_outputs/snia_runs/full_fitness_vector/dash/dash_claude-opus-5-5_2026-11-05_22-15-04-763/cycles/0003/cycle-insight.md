# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants were evaluated. Two built on cycle 0002's v003 (two-hit gate plus MRU demotion): v001 reordered the lookup to check the normal tier before stash, and v002 added probing overflow. The third, v003, applied MRU demotion to the baseline with no gate. There are no Winners. v002 was the best result, with a very small hit-rate gain on every cell and better tails on both `put` and `get`. v003 showed that MRU demotion raises hit rate even without the gate, but it did not recover baseline latency.

## Patterns

- Lookup order is not the lever for `get` latency. Searching stash last (v001) left hit rate unchanged and made `get` p50 and p99 worse. Stash hits make up a large enough share of all hits that stash-first is the better order.
- The `get` slowdown follows stash-hit traffic, not the gate. Ungated MRU demotion (v003) reached the same slower `get` band as the gated variants. The likely cost is the stash-hit promotion chain (remove, promote, demote cascade), which runs more often when stash keeps items longer.
- Promotion placement and demotion placement are not independent hit-rate levers. Once demoted items land at stash MRU, overflowing promotions into probing (v002) adds very little retention. What overflow does deliver is fewer demotion cascades, which reversed most of the `put` p99 regression caused by stash pressure. This is the clearest evidence so far that cascade count drives the tail.
- MRU demotion's hit-rate gain is again largest on hm_0 at the large size, with or without the gate. That cell is consistently where retention changes decide the result.

## Open questions

- Can the stash-hit promotion path itself be made cheaper, for example by skipping or deferring the demotion cascade when it is not needed, without losing retention?
- With v002's fewer cascades, how far is the gated, MRU-demoting line from dominating the baseline? Is the remaining gap only `get` p50?
- Would probing overflow added to ungated MRU demotion (v003 here) recover enough tail latency to make that cheaper branch competitive?

## Continuation

Take v002 (gate + MRU demotion + probing overflow) as the new base. It has the best combined hit rate and tail profile so far. Aim latency work at the cost of each stash-hit promotion and at reducing demotion cascades further. Drop lookup-reordering ideas and stop treating the gate as the source of the `get` slowdown. Optionally try overflow on the ungated MRU branch as a cheaper alternative line.
