# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants were built on cycle 0001's two-hit gate (v002) and all were evaluated: leave the item in place on the first stash hit (v001), send twice-hit items into free probing space (v002), and demote normal-tier victims to the stash MRU end (v003). Each one improved median `get` slightly, and none improved tail latency. There are no Winners. v003 came closest, with higher hit rate everywhere and slightly lower `get` p50, but its tail got slightly worse.

## Patterns

- The cohort settled one question: the gate's per-op cost is not on the first-hit path. Removing the first-hit MRU move (v001) helped p50 only a little, left p99 unchanged, and cost some hit rate. The tail cost comes from the second-hit promote/demote cascade and from lookup length.
- Changes that keep proven items alive longer helped hit rate. v002 did this by using free probing space instead of evicting a target resident. v003 did it by giving demoted items a full stash residency. v003's gain was largest on hm_0 at the large size, the same configuration that gained most from the gate in cycle 0001 and lost most in v001. That configuration is the main place where re-reference gaps decide the result.
- Tail latency got slightly worse in every variant, each for its own reason: the cascade (v001), a three-bucket lookup for items placed in probing (v002), and stash occupancy pressure on `put` (v003). Stash pressure is now the leading explanation for the `put` regression, which v003 made worse. v002 lowered demotions into stash and barely changed `put`, so the cause is not settled.
- v002 and v003 work on different parts of the policy. v002 changes where promotions land, and v003 changes where demotions land. Neither has been tried together with the other.

## Open questions

- Does combining v003 (MRU demotion) with v002 (probing overflow) stack the hit-rate gains? Would v002's fewer demotions offset the stash pressure v003 adds?
- Can the probing-overflow lookup penalty be removed, for example by changing the search order or moving items back into target once it has space, without giving up its hit-rate gain?
- Is the remaining `put` p99 regression caused by stash fullness, or is it benchmark noise? None of the variants has separated the two.

## Continuation

Take v003 (MRU demotion on the gate) as the new base. It is the strongest hit-rate result, and its only cost is a small tail regression. Next, try v003 combined with v002's probing overflow, and look for a way to shorten the lookup for items placed in probing. Drop the first-hit no-reorder idea (v001): it costs hit rate and does not help the tail. Aim latency work at the second-hit cascade and at stash occupancy.
