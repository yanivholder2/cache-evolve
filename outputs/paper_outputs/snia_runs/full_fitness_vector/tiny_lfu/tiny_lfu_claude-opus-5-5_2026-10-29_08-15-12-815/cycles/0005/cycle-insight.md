# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Each variant took one item from cycle 0004's continuation. v001 rewrote the u32-link residency codegen on the 24-byte line. v002 added a size-aware window floor on top of conservative update. v003 replaced the exact four-way min with a pairwise min. All three are Winners. v001 won on per-op-time and on the cache struct's size, with hit-rate unchanged. v002 won a small hit-rate gain. v003 matched its parent's hit-rate with a cheaper update rule. v002 and v003 both got much slower on per-op-time, and neither diff explains it.

## Patterns

- The u32-link slowdown is fixed, and the cause is confirmed as residency codegen. Keeping indices in u32 throughout, writing tagged links in one store, and indexing without bounds checks made the 24-byte node about as fast as the 40-byte one or faster. Put gained more than get. So the 24-byte layout now has no latency cost, and it is the residency layer to build on.
- The hit-rate levers still add up, but the gains are getting smaller. The window floor leaves the large size bit-identical to its parent and helps only the small size, mostly on hm_0. Pairwise conservative update keeps nearly all of full conservative update's accuracy. The exact global minimum turned out not to matter, so a cheaper approximation is acceptable.
- Cycle 0004's diagnosis that the serial `min` chain sets latency now looks wrong. Shortening the chain did not recover latency, and the chain is too short to have caused the slowdown. The cost seen when conservative update was added is more likely an inlining/codegen effect around `increment_hashed`, or noise.
- The per-op-time measurement is not reliable at this point. v002's hot path is byte-identical to its parent, yet it slowed down on every op, with tails hit hardest. v003's slowdown has the same tail-heavy shape. v001's large speedup ran in the same cycle. Any per-op-time comparison across this cohort may partly reflect host conditions and should be confirmed on a stable host.

## Open questions

- Did v002 and v003 really slow down, or did the host change during the run? An interleaved re-run of v001, v002, v003 and their parents would tell.
- Does `increment_hashed` stop being inlined into `get`/`put` once conservative update is added, in either the full or the pairwise form?
- Why is the window floor's small-size gain specific to the trace (hm_0 gains, web_0 barely moves)?
- Cycle 0004's unexplained hit-rate mismatch between the 24-byte and 40-byte lines is still unresolved, and it needs an answer before the lines are merged.

## Continuation

Merge into one line: v001's u32 residency layer, v002's window floor, and v003's pairwise conservative update. Before the merge, check that the 24-byte line's sketch matches the 40-byte line's hit-rate exactly. Force `increment_hashed` inline (`#[inline(always)]`) or check the assembly, and judge per-op-time only from repeated or interleaved runs against the parent. Do not try more variants that only shorten the min chain, and do not count v002's or v003's latency numbers against them until they are re-measured.
