# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

The cohort had three single-purpose tests: v001 merged cycle-3's two filters (reuse-gated main-victim ghosting plus freq/reused reset on graduation), v002 raised the ghost bound from `main_size` to the full capacity, and v003 merged the resident and ghost indexes into one map. Only v001 was a real win. It improved hit rate at every trace/size point, with entry size unchanged and no latency cost. v002 regressed web_0 and large hm_0, and v003 kept hit rates bit-identical but got slower. Both count as Winners only by rank. Neither should be built on.

## Patterns

- The filters add up. Gating ghosts on reuse and resetting credit at graduation stack cleanly once both judge a key only by its reuse inside main. hm_0 gains more than web_0, which matches every cycle so far: hm_0 responds to how main retains keys.
- More ghost history is harmful, not neutral. A longer window lets stale reuse back into main, where it pushes out live residents. Cycles 3 and 4 together point one way: ghost budget should be spent more selectively, not made larger. This rules out the ghost bound as the cause of web_0's remaining large-size gap.
- Probe count is not the bottleneck for timing. Halving probes lost to higher load factor and wider buckets, which hurt the tails most. Table occupancy and bucket width matter more than the number of lookups. Structural timing work now needs to budget for memory layout as well as the algorithm.
- Fixed-struct size keeps shifting (v002 up, v003 down) while per-entry metadata stays flat across the cohort. The summary metric still misses live ghost memory.

## Open questions

- Is the small-queue share (`capacity / 4`) what's left behind web_0's large-size loss? It is the last remaining candidate.
- Now that the merge works, do the graduation threshold or `MAX_FREQ` give more gain on hm_0 without costing web_0?
- Would a unified index pay off with generous headroom or a compact slot encoding (a `u32` slab index plus a ghost flag bit), or is the two-table layout already close to optimal?

## Continuation

Use v001 (Fx slab + both filters) as the only parent. Keep the ghost bound at `main_size` or lower, and drop the idea of a longer ghost. For web_0, test the small-queue share one variable at a time. For hm_0, try main-retention knobs (`MAX_FREQ`, graduation threshold) as separate variants. If you retry index merging, pair it with explicit load-factor headroom or a compact slot. Otherwise, drop structural probe-count work. As before, give no timing credit to policy-only diffs.
