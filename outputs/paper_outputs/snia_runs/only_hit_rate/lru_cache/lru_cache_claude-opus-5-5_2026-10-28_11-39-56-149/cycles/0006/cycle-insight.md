# Cycle 0006 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants changed one knob of the climber in cycle 0004's v002 lineage. v001 raised the step cap 4x. v002 made a reversal wait for two drops in a row. v003 tied the sample period to capacity at the large size only. v003 is the nominal Winner because it lost the least. It matched its parent exactly at small size and was slightly worse in both large-size cells, so it did not improve anything. For the second cycle in a row there was no real gain.

## Patterns

- The climber's knobs are now used up. Over cycles 0005 and 0006, the ceiling, a shorter period, a longer period, a larger step and a slower flip rule have all been tried. Each one was neutral or worse. The cycle 0004 settings sit at a local optimum.
- Small-size web_0 did not move under any climber change. Faster steps and slower reversals both failed to lift it, and slower reversals hurt it the most. Its remaining gap is probably structural, coming from admission, the duel or how the main area is split, and not from where the window settles.
- Single-sample drops are real signals, not noise from a half-applied resize. Delaying reactions cost the most on the cell the change was aimed at. v003 showed that a capped step settles quickly, so the cycle 0005 "lazy-resize transient" diagnosis is withdrawn.
- The step size relative to capacity is what matters. A large step amplifies noise on small-size hm_0, where one-shot filtering is still the fragile, load-bearing property. At the large size, the capped step limits how many rounds the climber gets, so a longer period only slows it down.
- For the sixth cycle, only hit-rate was measured. `win_cap` was again not read, although v001 may have produced a debug log of it.

## Open questions

- Does `win_cap` at small size oscillate or settle? Read the v001 `climb` log if it exists.
- If small-size web_0 is limited by admission or the duel, which part is it: the doorkeeper's cold first-touch estimates, or how the main area is split between probation and protected?
- Would a step proportional to capacity at the large size only (about 1% or less), with the period scaled to match, help large-size web_0 without touching small size?

## Continuation

Stop tuning the climber. Treat cycle 0004's v002 as the parent and leave its climber settings alone. Next, aim at admission and the main area: test whether the doorkeeper still costs web_0 now that the window adapts, and try varying the main area's probation/protected split. A large-size-only step scaled to capacity is the one climber idea still worth testing. Drop hysteresis, larger fixed step caps and period-only changes. Read `win_cap` logs, and get `metadata-size` and `per-op-time` reported, which is now six cycles overdue.
