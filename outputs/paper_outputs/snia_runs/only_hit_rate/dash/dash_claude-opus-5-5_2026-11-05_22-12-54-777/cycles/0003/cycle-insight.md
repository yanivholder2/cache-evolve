# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants made one isolated change on top of cycle 0002's v002 (frequency-aware 8-slot tail victim). v001 moved stash→target landing to the MRU end. v002 put demoted items at the stash MRU end when their counter was 2 or more. v003 narrowed the scan window to 4 and lowered the counter cap to 7. None of them beat the parent. v002 won only because it was essentially neutral: hm_0 did not change and web_0 dropped by a rounding-level amount. The incumbent's hit-rate effectively stalled this cycle.

## Patterns

- Once eviction reads the frequency counter, insert position stops working as a lever. v002's gated demotion was redundant with the tail scan. v001's MRU landing was harmful, not neutral: it moved new arrivals out of the scan window, so the scan evicted established residents instead, and it gave newly promoted items a shorter path to probing. Front landing is part of how the filter works.
- MRU promotion has now hurt web_0 in two cycles. The first time it was bundled with other changes; this time it was applied alone. So the cause is MRU landing itself, not cycle 0002's trigger or demotion changes.
- The 8-slot window does useful work. Narrowing it cost a little on every cell, and the most on hm_0 at the small size, which is where the filter had gained the most. Faster ageing gave no visible benefit in return.
- hm_0's long-gap reuse is still unserved. Changes to recency position cannot reach it.
- Per-op-time has now gone unmeasured for three cycles, even though H03 explicitly asked for it. Every cost/benefit argument about the eviction path is still a guess.

## Open questions

- What does the 8-slot scan plus halve-on-cap actually cost in per-op-time, and does v003's cheaper configuration save anything at all?
- Of v003's two changes, which one caused the hm_0 small-size loss: the narrower window or the lower cap? Testing window 4 with cap 15, and window 8 with cap 7, would separate them.
- Would a wider window (more than 8), or a different ageing rule, help hm_0 more than any change to insertion?
- Would a counter-gated stash→target landing (Back only when the counter is above 1) keep v001's small hm_0 gain without hurting web_0?

## Continuation

Keep cycle 0002's v002 as the effective parent. Drop insert-position changes: no more blanket MRU promotion and no more gated demotion. The next hypotheses should target what the tail scan considers (window width above 8, how counters age) or how much stash capacity there is for hm_0's long-gap reuse. Before trading hit-rate for cost again, the evaluation must actually report per-op-time. Without that, cost-reduction variants like v003 cannot be judged.
