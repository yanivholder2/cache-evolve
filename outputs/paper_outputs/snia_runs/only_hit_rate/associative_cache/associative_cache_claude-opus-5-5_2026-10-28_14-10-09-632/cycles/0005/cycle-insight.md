# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants built on cycle 0004 v002 (GCLOCK main + probation FIFO), each testing one knob in isolation. v001 added a main-sized ghost ring for warm admission. v002 had promoted items carry a non-zero counter into main. v003 added an absolute probation-depth floor. v003 is the Winner. It was the only variant with no regressions, and it improved both traces at the small size, while the large-bucket cells stayed exactly the same as the parent.

## Patterns

- Depth helped, and both admission-strength changes hurt. Whenever the bar for entering main got lower or main got more counter mass (v001 by ghost match, v002 by carried counter), main churned more and established blocks decayed faster, mostly on web_0. Only a hit during probation is a reliable promotion signal. Only adding probation depth helped, because it gives more blocks the chance to earn that hit.
- In this lineage, the probation/protected trade-off is not zero-sum, which is the opposite of the LRU line. Main in small buckets shrank to half, and hm_0 still gained. A frequency-ranked main whose counters are decremented only on promotion needs fewer slots than an LRU protected segment. This removes the cycle 0002–0003 rule that "hm_0 wants protected and web_0 wants probation" for this design.
- Ghost admission has now failed in two lineages and at two sizings (cycle 0003 undersized, cycle 0005 main-sized). With enough coverage it brings back hm_0's near-miss reuse but re-admits web_0's single-return blocks. This is a trace split, not a sizing problem.
- The promoted block's position behind the hand already gives it a full rotation of grace. Adding a counter on top of that is redundant and harmful. This settles cycle 0004's open question with a no. v003's own takeaway still lists a non-zero promotion counter as a candidate, but v002 refuted that idea.
- The web_0 gain at the small size is real but modest, so depth explains only part of the gap. Nothing in this cohort moved the large-bucket cells upward.
- Per-op-time went unmeasured for the fifth cycle in a row. The insights say it is absent from the fitness vector itself, so this is a harness gap, not a variant omission.

## Open questions

- Does pushing the floor further (beyond half the bucket in small buckets) keep helping both traces, and where does hm_0 start to lose main capacity?
- Does a deeper probation share at the large size (such as a fraction above a quarter in 1024-slot buckets) help web_0 there, or does it weaken the filtering that cycle 0004 gained?
- What explains the rest of web_0's small-size gap, if not probation depth or admission strength?

## Continuation

Make cycle 0005 v003 (GCLOCK + probation with a depth floor) the parent. Sweep probation depth as the main lever: a higher floor in small buckets and a larger fraction in large buckets, possibly adapted with set dueling on `small_len`. Retire ghost/warm admission and non-zero promotion counters, and keep the reset-to-0 on promotion. Stop requiring per-op-time from variants until the harness adds it to the fitness vector, and flag that gap to whoever owns the harness.
