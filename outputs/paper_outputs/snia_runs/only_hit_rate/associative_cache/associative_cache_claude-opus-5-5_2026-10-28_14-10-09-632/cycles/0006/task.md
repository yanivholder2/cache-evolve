## Prior cycles digest

### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Two variants extended cycle 0002's bimodal-insertion winner. v001 replaced the fixed MRU-sample rate with a per-bucket PSEL feedback counter. v003 added the absolute probation floor. The third variant, v002, added ghost-ring warm admission to the GCLOCK branch. The Winner is v003, but it only moved small-bucket cells, and it moved them as a trade: web_0 gained and hm_0 lost. No variant produced a clean gain on both traces.

## Patterns

- All three variants added a short per-bucket memory (a sample ring, a ghost ring, or a fixed probation depth), and in each case that memory was sized below the reuse distance it was meant to catch. In both ring-based variants the memory forgot items before they could produce a signal. The failures were mostly about sizing, not about the ideas.
- The floor and MRU sampling do not stack. Both split the same fixed bucket space: making probation deeper shrinks the protected region where long-reuse hm_0 blocks survive. This confirms the trace split from cycle 0002 at the level of mechanism. hm_0 wants a large protected region and web_0 wants a deep probation region.
- Every change was inactive or harmful in the large buckets. The floor never engages there. The short sample ring biased PSEL toward aggressive MRU sampling, which made web_0 pollution worse. Warm admission without enough memory polluted GCLOCK. Nothing this cycle improved the large size.
- Feedback signals were miscalibrated as well as too short. PSEL rewarded any re-hit, including hits that probation insertion would have caught anyway. Warm credit added only one sweep of extra protection.
- For the third cycle in a row, per-op-time and metadata-size went unmeasured. This cycle added more unmeasured cost: linear scans on the miss path for both rings.

## Open questions

- Would true set dueling (leader buckets fixed to the v001-style depth and the v002-style depth, followers taking the winner) settle the probation/protected split per workload, where per-bucket self-feedback failed?
- Does PSEL feedback work once the tracker covers a full bucket lifetime (for example a per-item sampled bit) and credits only hits after probation?
- Is ghost admission on GCLOCK worth pursuing with a ring that covers a full rotation and a larger credit, or should that direction be dropped?

## Continuation

Pursue adaptive selection of the probation/protected split, preferably leader/follower set dueling between cycle 0002 v001's and v002's insertion depths, with no fixed combined depth. Any feedback state must be sized to the bucket's lifetime. Keep the GCLOCK branch, but try ghost admission only once more, with full-rotation coverage; drop it if that still shows no effect. Stop stacking the floor onto BIP, and require per-op-time measurement.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Two variants built on cycle 0002 v002 (LRU + bimodal insertion). v001 drove the MRU-sample rate with a PSEL counter fed by per-item tags. v003 added graded two-step promotion. The third, v002, put an S3-FIFO-style probation ring in front of the cycle 0002 GCLOCK bucket. v002 is the Winner. It improved hm_0 at both sizes and gave web_0 at the large size its biggest gain, beating that hypothesis's refutation threshold. web_0 at the small size stayed flat. This is the first cycle since 0001 where the large-bucket cells clearly moved.

## Patterns

- Cold insertion carries over to CLOCK, and it works better there than in the LRU lineage. In v002, a new item only gets into the frequency-ranked main region if it is hit while in probation, and the main sweep only runs on promotions. That filtered scans on web_0 and also kept hm_0's reused blocks protected, so it is the first change to help both traces without a trade-off. The two lineages have now traded places: GCLOCK+probation leads, and the LRU/BIP line is stuck.
- Both LRU-lineage variants traded one trace against the other again, and each failure came down to mechanism detail, not the idea itself. v001's PSEL fixed cycle 0003's lost-signal problem: per-item tags last for the item's whole lifetime. But the counter's symmetric ±1 update, starting at mid-range, votes on whether *most* samples hit, not on whether sampling pays off. So it drifted toward LIP and gave back hm_0's gain. In v003, every lower-half hit landed in one shared slot, so the protected half was cut off from the reuse stream.
- Every variant still runs into the same limit: fixed-fraction probation is too short in 128-slot buckets for web_0's late second touches. That held for the LIP lineage in cycles 0001–0003, and it now holds for v002's `len/4` ring too.
- For the fourth cycle in a row, per-op-time went unmeasured, even though all three hypotheses asked for it.

## Open questions

- Would a probation ring that is deeper in small buckets, or that adapts its size (S3-FIFO-style ghost or set dueling on `small_len`), recover web_0 at the small size without weakening the filtering in large buckets?
- Should promoted items enter main with a non-zero counter, so they are not the next sweep victim?
- Can v001's tag-based PSEL be saved with an asymmetric update, a start in the higher-sampling band, and a reward test that also counts promotions, or should the LRU/BIP line be retired?

## Continuation

Make cycle 0004 v002 (GCLOCK + probation FIFO) the main lineage. Tune or adapt `small_len`, aiming at web_0 at the small size, and try giving promotions a non-zero starting counter. At most one LRU-lineage variant should be kept: the asymmetric-PSEL fix. Drop graded promotion through a single boundary slot. Per-op-time must be reported, or the variant is not accepted.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants built on cycle 0004 v002 (GCLOCK main + probation FIFO), each testing one knob in isolation. v001 added a main-sized ghost ring for warm admission. v002 had promoted items carry a non-zero counter into main. v003 added an absolute probation-depth floor. v003 is the Winner. It was the only variant with no regressions, and it improved both traces at the small size, while the large-bucket cells stayed exactly the same as the parent.

## Patterns

- Depth helped, and both admission-strength changes hurt. Whenever the bar for entering main got lower or main got more counter mass (v001 by ghost match, v002 by carried counter), main churned more and established blocks decayed faster, mostly on web_0. Only a hit during probation is a reliable promotion signal. Only adding probation depth helped, because it gives more blocks the chance to earn that hit.
- In this lineage, the probation/protected trade-off is not zero-sum, which is the opposite of the LRU line. Main in small buckets shrank to half, and hm_0 still gained. A frequency-ranked main whose counters are decremented only on promotion needs fewer slots than an LRU protected segment. This removes the cycle 0002–0003 rule that "hm_0 wants protected and web_0 wants probation" for this design.
- Ghost admission has now failed in two lineages and at two sizings (cycle 0003 undersized, cycle 0005 main-sized). With enough coverage it brings back hm_0's near-miss reuse but re-admits web_0's single-return blocks. This is a trace split, not a sizing problem.
- The promoted block's position behind the hand already gives it a full rotation of grace. Adding a counter on top of that is redundant and harmful. This settles cycle 0004's open question with a no. v003's own takeaway still lists a non-zero promotion counter as a candidate, but v002 refuted that idea.
- The web_0 gain at the small size is real but modest, so depth explains only part of the gap. Nothing in this cohort moved the large-bucket cells upward.
- Per-op-time went unmeasured for the fifth cycle in a row. The insights say it is absent from the fitness vector itself, so this is a harness gap, not a variant omission.

## Open questions

- Does pushing the floor further (beyond half the bucket in small buckets) keep helping both traces, and where does hm_0 start to lose main capacity?
- Does a deeper probation share at the large size (such as a fraction above a quarter in 1024-slot buckets) help web_0 there, or does it weaken the filtering that cycle 0004 gained?
- What explains the rest of web_0's small-size gap, if not probation depth or admission strength?

## Continuation

Make cycle 0005 v003 (GCLOCK + probation with a depth floor) the parent. Sweep probation depth as the main lever: a higher floor in small buckets and a larger fraction in large buckets, possibly adapted with set dueling on `small_len`. Retire ghost/warm admission and non-zero promotion counters, and keep the reset-to-0 on promotion. Stop requiring per-op-time from variants until the harness adds it to the fitness vector, and flag that gap to whoever owns the harness.
