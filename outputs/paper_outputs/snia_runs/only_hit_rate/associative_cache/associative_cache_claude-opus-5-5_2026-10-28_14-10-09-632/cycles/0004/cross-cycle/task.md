### Cycle 0001

# Cycle 0001 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants changed ClassicLRU's per-bucket ordering. One changed where new items are inserted (v001, LIP-style insertion at len/4). One limited how far a hit is promoted (v002). One replaced the ordering with CLOCK second-chance (v003). The Winner, v001, is the only variant that changes where *new* items land. It raised hit-rate on every trace×size cell.

## Patterns

- What decides hit-rate on the MSR traces is how a new item ranks against a re-referenced item. v001 put new items below reused ones and won. v002 left new items at MRU but weakened promotion, so new items outranked reused ones, and hit-rate dropped (most on hm_0 at the larger size).
- Scan resistance matters more in the larger 1024-slot buckets. In the 128-slot buckets, v001's fixed-fraction probation window is short, so some real reuse is cut off.
- Coarser recency tracking (CLOCK) did not hurt hit-rate. It was level or slightly better, especially at the small size. Exact LRU order does not appear to be what drives hit-rate here.
- None of the variants measured per-op-time or metadata-size. Any latency claim (H03's main goal, H02's side claim, v001's cost of inserting mid-vector) is still untested.

## Open questions

- Does CLOCK (v003) actually lower get/put latency, now that we know it costs no hit-rate?
- Would a deeper insertion point, or a probation depth that scales with bucket size, recover the lost hits at 16384 without losing the gain at 131072?
- Can the two ideas be combined, i.e. CLOCK with a cold insertion position? Does graded promotion become useful once inserts land low?

## Continuation

Build on v001. Tune `INSERT_FRACTION_DIV` toward a deeper insertion point, or make probation depth scale with bucket size, focusing on the 16384 size. Make sure per-op-time is measured, and re-test CLOCK for latency, possibly combined with cold insertion. Drop bounded promotion on its own while new items still enter at MRU.


### Cycle 0002

# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Two variants extended cycle 0001's cold-insertion winner (v001). v001 added an absolute probation floor. v002 added BIP-style occasional MRU insertion. The third variant, v003, upgraded CLOCK to a 2-bit GCLOCK counter. The Winner is v002. Its overall gain was small and came with a split by trace: it helped hm_0, mostly at the small size, and hurt web_0.

## Patterns

- Both v001-lineage variants went after the same small-bucket shortfall, and both recovered some of it. hm_0 benefited more than web_0 each time, so hm_0 has meaningful reuse beyond the original probation window at 16384.
- Gains at the small size don't carry over to the large size. Lengthening probation left 1024-slot buckets unchanged. Sending items to MRU hurt them on web_0, where cold traffic is mostly scan-like and already drained well. A single fixed rule can't serve both trace types.
- The frequency-aware CLOCK line (v003) improved on its parent in every trace×size cell, especially on hm_0 at the large size, and it does no element shifting. It was not the Winner, but it is now a credible second lineage. Its advantage grows with bucket size, where the v001 line has the least room left to improve.
- For the second cycle in a row, no variant measured per-op-time or metadata-size. Every cost claim is still untested: mid-vector inserts, GCLOCK's multi-rotation sweeps, and the full-bucket candidate scan.

## Open questions

- Would adaptive insertion fix v002's trace split? For example, DIP-style set dueling between LIP and BIP, or an MRU-insert rate that scales with bucket size.
- Do the absolute floor (v001) and occasional MRU insert (v002) stack, or do they recover the same reuse?
- Does GCLOCK's hit-rate gain hold once its worst-case sweep cost is measured? And can it take a cold-insertion analogue, such as starting new items below already-referenced ones?

## Continuation

Build on v002, but replace its fixed period with an adaptive policy (set dueling, or a rate tied to bucket size and trace behavior) so web_0 stops losing hits. Try combining it with v001's probation floor. Keep the GCLOCK lineage (cycle 0002 v003) going as a parallel branch, since it scales well to large buckets. Make per-op-time measurement a requirement, not an option. Drop further tuning of the BIP period alone.


### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Two variants extended cycle 0002's bimodal-insertion winner. v001 replaced the fixed MRU-sample rate with a per-bucket PSEL feedback counter. v003 added the absolute probation floor. The third variant, v002, added ghost-ring warm admission to the GCLOCK branch. The Winner is v003, but it only moved small-bucket cells, and it moved them as a trade: web_0 gained and hm_0 lost. No variant produced a clean gain on both traces.

## Patterns

- All three variants added a short per-bucket memory (a sample ring, a ghost ring, or a fixed probation depth), and in each case that memory was sized below the reuse distance it was meant to catch. In both ring-based variants the memory forgot items before they could produce a signal. The failures were mostly about sizing, not about the ideas.
- The floor and MRU sampling do not stack. Both split the same fixed bucket space: making probation deeper shrinks the protected region where long-reuse hm_0 blocks survive. This confirms the trace split from cycle 0002 at the level of mechanism. hm_0 wants a large protected region and web_0 wants a deep probation region.
- Every change was inactive or harmful in the large buckets. The floor never engages there. The short sample ring biased PSEL toward aggressive MRU sampling, which made web_0 pollution worse. Warm admission without enough memory polluted GCLOCK. Nothing this cycle improved the large size.
- Feedback signals were miscalibrated as well as too short. PSEL rewarded any re-hit, including hits that probation insertion would have caught anyway. Warm credit added only one sweep of extra protection.
- For the third cycle in a row, per-op-time and metadata-size went unmeasured. This cycle added more unmeasured cost: linear scans on the miss path for both rings.

## Open questions

- Would true set dueling (leader buckets fixed to the v001-style depth and the v002-style depth, followers taking the winner) settle the probation/protected split per workload, where per-bucket self-feedback failed?
- Does PSEL feedback work once the tracker covers a full bucket lifetime (for example a per-item sampled bit) and credits only hits after probation?
- Is ghost admission on GCLOCK worth pursuing with a ring that covers a full rotation and a larger credit, or should that direction be dropped?

## Continuation

Pursue adaptive selection of the probation/protected split, preferably leader/follower set dueling between cycle 0002 v001's and v002's insertion depths, with no fixed combined depth. Any feedback state must be sized to the bucket's lifetime. Keep the GCLOCK branch, but try ghost admission only once more, with full-rotation coverage; drop it if that still shows no effect. Stop stacking the floor onto BIP, and require per-op-time measurement.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Two variants built on cycle 0002 v002 (LRU + bimodal insertion). v001 drove the MRU-sample rate with a PSEL counter fed by per-item tags. v003 added graded two-step promotion. The third, v002, put an S3-FIFO-style probation ring in front of the cycle 0002 GCLOCK bucket. v002 is the Winner. It improved hm_0 at both sizes and gave web_0 at the large size its biggest gain, beating that hypothesis's refutation threshold. web_0 at the small size stayed flat. This is the first cycle since 0001 where the large-bucket cells clearly moved.

## Patterns

- Cold insertion carries over to CLOCK, and it works better there than in the LRU lineage. In v002, a new item only gets into the frequency-ranked main region if it is hit while in probation, and the main sweep only runs on promotions. That filtered scans on web_0 and also kept hm_0's reused blocks protected, so it is the first change to help both traces without a trade-off. The two lineages have now traded places: GCLOCK+probation leads, and the LRU/BIP line is stuck.
- Both LRU-lineage variants traded one trace against the other again, and each failure came down to mechanism detail, not the idea itself. v001's PSEL fixed cycle 0003's lost-signal problem: per-item tags last for the item's whole lifetime. But the counter's symmetric ±1 update, starting at mid-range, votes on whether *most* samples hit, not on whether sampling pays off. So it drifted toward LIP and gave back hm_0's gain. In v003, every lower-half hit landed in one shared slot, so the protected half was cut off from the reuse stream.
- Every variant still runs into the same limit: fixed-fraction probation is too short in 128-slot buckets for web_0's late second touches. That held for the LIP lineage in cycles 0001–0003, and it now holds for v002's `len/4` ring too.
- For the fourth cycle in a row, per-op-time went unmeasured, even though all three hypotheses asked for it.

## Open questions

- Would a probation ring that is deeper in small buckets, or that adapts its size (S3-FIFO-style ghost or set dueling on `small_len`), recover web_0 at the small size without weakening the filtering in large buckets?
- Should promoted items enter main with a non-zero counter, so they are not the next sweep victim?
- Can v001's tag-based PSEL be saved with an asymmetric update, a start in the higher-sampling band, and a reward test that also counts promotions, or should the LRU/BIP line be retired?

## Continuation

Make cycle 0004 v002 (GCLOCK + probation FIFO) the main lineage. Tune or adapt `small_len`, aiming at web_0 at the small size, and try giving promotions a non-zero starting counter. At most one LRU-lineage variant should be kept: the asymmetric-PSEL fix. Drop graded promotion through a single boundary slot. Per-op-time must be reported, or the variant is not accepted.
