# Cycle 0007 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle tested three orthogonal approaches to extend the Cycle 0006 winner (two-pass LRU victim selection with 0.75× decay at capacity × 16 intervals): confirming the two-pass approach in isolation (v001, winner), attempting selective threshold-dependent decay to preserve weak frequency signals (v002, regressed), and introducing frequency-recency hybrid scoring as an alternative eviction paradigm tested against baseline (v003, showed promise on baseline). v001's win confirms the Cycle 0006 approach remains stable, while v002's failure definitively rules out selective decay, and v003 signals that hybrid scoring may merit deeper exploration when combined with the decay mechanism.

## Patterns

- **Two-pass victim selection is stable and confirmed.** v001's win, despite showing no measurable improvement over the parent, reflects that this refinement remains the best approach even as marginal gains shrink. The approach correctly captures temporal locality within equal-frequency tiers and has become the expected standard. The lack of measurable delta suggests victim-selection precision is no longer the main bottleneck; the decay mechanism has become so effective that tiebreaker quality no longer moves hit-rate significantly.

- **Selective decay uniformly fails; uniform decay is locked in.** v002's regression when preserving weak frequency signals (freq < 4) confirms Cycle 0005's finding that uniform decay is superior. Attempting to shield newly-accessed items from decay breaks the cache's ability to discriminate between ephemeral and persistent access patterns. The workload requires all items to decay proportionally; threshold-based exemptions allow weak-frequency items to remain artificially inflated and degrade eviction quality.

- **Frequency-recency hybrid scoring shows potential but was not tested against the decay incumbent.** v003 demonstrated clear improvement over baseline with a hybrid score combining frequency (×100 weight) and recency position. However, this fresh approach bypassed the proven decay mechanism entirely, leaving open whether hybrid scoring would compound with decay or conflict with it. The contrast between v003's help and v002's hurt suggests the workload may benefit from mixing frequency with other decision dimensions, but this requires validation within the decay framework.

## Open questions

- How does v003's frequency-recency hybrid scoring perform when combined with the 0.75× decay mechanism and two-pass LRU tie-breaking? Does hybrid scoring deliver additive gains on top of the incumbent, or does the decay mechanism already capture the benefit?

- Are victim-selection refinements now exhausted? v001's neutral delta despite being the winner suggests the cache may have reached the optimization ceiling for eviction precision. Should exploration pivot away from "how to evict" toward "what signals to use for eviction"?

- Does v003's hybrid score formula (freq × 100 + position) generalize, or is the 100× weighting tuned to this workload? Should coefficient sensitivity testing be revisited for the hybrid approach if it shows promise with decay?

## Continuation

Retain v001's two-pass victim selection as the baseline and lock in the full stack: 0.75× decay at capacity × 16 intervals plus two-pass LRU tie-breaking. Decay is conclusively optimized; stop revisiting threshold-based or alternative decay mechanics. **Prioritize investigation of v003's hybrid scoring**: test it in combination with the incumbent's decay mechanism to determine whether recency-weighted eviction scores deliver gains beyond frequency-only selection. If hybrid scoring shows measurable improvement when paired with decay, pursue coefficient optimization; if it remains neutral or regresses, abandon the approach and accept that the cache may have reached saturation on victim-selection improvements. The optimization window appears to be shifting from *eviction precision* back toward *eviction signal design*; the next cycle should clarify whether that window has opened or closed.
