# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle stress-tested the prior Winner's frequency-first rule from three
angles: composing it with probationary front admission (v001), aging its
counters under eviction pressure (v002), and a clean-sheet segmented-LRU
built on `lfu_counter` as a promote-on-second-hit flag (v003). Only v003 won;
both modifications to the inherited frequency rule regressed below their parent.

## Patterns

- The two levers from Cycle 0001 do not compose — they conflict. Stacking
  front admission onto frequency-first eviction makes a fresh key
  simultaneously the recency-oldest and minimum-frequency entry, turning it
  into the immediate victim and discarding rising keys at probation.
- The winning scan-resistance came from explicit *segmentation* with a
  promote-on-second-hit rule, not from tuning a single frequency scalar.
  Demanding proof of reuse before granting protection beat both pure-LFU
  victim selection and single-position LRU admission.
- The dominant pressure on this workload is capacity collision, not
  staleness: aging the survivors' counters removed exactly the durable-count
  protection that made high-frequency keys valuable. "Once-hot immortality"
  was a feature here, not a failure mode.
- Both winning and losing variants still pay an O(bucket_size) linear victim
  scan; the per-op cost of that scan remains structurally present but largely
  unmeasured in the reported vectors.

## Open questions

- Can the linear front-scan for the first probationary item be made O(1)
  (e.g. a tracked segment boundary) without losing the SLRU hit-rate gain?
- Is there a probationary/protected sizing ratio that improves on the
  implicit split, or does promote-on-second-hit already capture most of it?
- Since aging hurt and immortality helped, is there any workload regime
  (shifting working set) where staleness *would* dominate — or is this trace
  firmly collision-bound?

## Continuation

Build on v003's segmented bucket as the new baseline: it is the strongest
scan-resistant admission scheme so far. Pursue cost-side refinements —
especially eliminating the linear probationary scan — and segment-sizing
tuning, while keeping hit-rate the primary axis. Drop both counter aging and
front-admission composition; this cycle showed they erode the protection that
durable frequency/segmentation provides on this workload.
