### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle attempted to advance the stash mechanism via three directions: filtering refinement at proven 25% capacity (v001), and capacity saturation exploration at 20% and 30% (v002, v003). Only v001 compiled and executed; it confirmed that occupancy-aware selective insertion adds no value on top of the existing 25% capacity baseline. The two capacity-exploration variants encountered the same Rust borrow checker constraint, preventing direct measurement of the efficiency frontier and saturation boundary.

## Patterns

- **Filtering hits a ceiling at 25% capacity**: v001's selective insertion—designed to avoid capturing low-value evictions from under-occupied buckets—yielded zero improvement. This validates the Cycle 0002 insight that raw capacity is the binding constraint; the 25% stash already captures all re-use-worthy items, leaving no room for filtering to add value. Items evicted from lightly-loaded buckets are naturally discarded by FIFO anyway, making proactive filtering redundant.

- **Architectural constraints block capacity exploration**: Both v002 (20%) and v003 (30%) failed at the build gate with identical borrow checker errors. This suggests the stash scaling axis—already proven productive through 25%—may hit hard architectural limits when attempting further refinements or explorations. The constraint lies in how stash access is sequenced within a single operation.

- **Stash-centric optimization shows diminishing returns**: After three cycles focusing exclusively on stash tuning (size, eviction order, insertion filtering), the last successful improvement (Cycle 0002's capacity doubling) yielded only 1.2% hit-rate gain. v001's null result indicates saturation is near or already reached.

## Open questions

- What is the true capacity saturation point (15%, 20%, 25%, or beyond)? The build failures prevented testing v002 and v003, leaving the efficiency frontier unmapped.
- Do the borrow checker errors reflect fundamental architectural constraints in the stash design, or can they be resolved with refactoring to enable further exploration?
- Has the stash mechanism exhausted its potential, or are entirely different levers (cache geometry, eviction policy outside the stash, workload adaptation) the next productivity axis?

## Continuation

v001's lack of improvement is instructive: filtering is unhelpful once capacity reaches 25%, confirming the working set is already fully captured. The build failures for v002 and v003 reveal an architectural bottleneck that blocks direct capacity saturation testing. Next cycle should either (1) resolve the borrow checker constraint through refactoring to enable systematic capacity exploration between 15–30%, or (2) shift focus away from stash tuning entirely—the mechanism has matured and stash-only refinements are showing zero or minimal gains. If pursuing (2), consider probing orthogonal axes: whether collision clustering is addressable at the geometry level, whether the workload exhibits phase-dependent behavior worth adapting to, or whether the cache's fundamental layout constrains further progress.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle marked a strategic pivot: after three cycles of stash-only refinement, geometric rebalancing re-entered the optimization space. The winner combines wider-bucket geometry with the proven 25% stash to attack collisions at their source while retaining strong recovery coverage. v001 achieved a 0.26% hit-rate improvement, validating that geometry and stash are complementary levers—neither alone suffices, but both together compound.

## Patterns

- **Orthogonal levers restore productivity after saturation**: Cycles 0002–0003 showed that stash tuning alone (capacity scaling, filtering, eviction ordering) faced diminishing returns. v001's success demonstrates that pivoting to geometry—an axis deprioritized after Cycle 0001—unlocks fresh gains. Wider buckets reduce collision-driven evictions feeding the stash, reducing demand on the recovery mechanism itself.

- **LRU ordering trails geometry in impact**: v002's LRU stash eviction outperforms baseline but underperforms v001's geometric rebalancing. This confirms that after three cycles of stash-internal optimization (capacity, filtering, now ordering), further refinements within the stash have limited upside. Collision reduction is now the more productive axis.

- **Both dimensions are binding constraints**: v003's attempt to trade stash capacity (15%) for geometry gains fails to match v001 (25% + geometry). The cache requires both levers operating together; geometry cannot fully compensate for undersized recovery coverage. This rejects the Cycle 0003 hypothesis that collision reduction could reduce stash overhead requirements.

- **Gains remain modest but consistent**: All three variants improved over baseline, with v001 winning by a narrow margin. The pattern mirrors Cycles 0002–0003, where each optimization achieves small incremental progress. The workload appears to have limited exploitable headroom remaining.

## Open questions

- What is the saturation point for geometric rebalancing? Are the 0.26% gains from the current bucket-width adjustment the peak, or could refined rebalancing ratios (e.g., different width-to-count trade-offs) push further?
- Does the synergy between geometry and 25% stash plateau at the current design, or is there room to optimize their interaction (e.g., adaptive geometry based on collision rate)?
- Have we reached the natural ceiling for this workload-cache pairing, or do entirely different optimization axes (workload adaptation, alternative eviction policies) remain unexplored?

## Continuation

v001 validated that geometry and stash are mutually reinforcing—the 0.26% gain, though modest, breaks the stash-only plateau and signals a productive direction. v002's LRU ordering shows secondary promise but cannot match geometric improvements; v003's stash-capacity trade-off definitively failed. Next cycle should either (1) refine geometric rebalancing further (test different bucket-width ratios and collision-reduction strategies to locate a higher-productivity region), or (2) assess whether the combined geometry + 25%-stash design has saturated the workload's exploitable margin. If geometric refinement yields only marginal gains, consider stepping back to evaluate whether fundamentally different levers (workload phase detection, alternative cache replacement policies beyond LRU, or redesigned bucket layouts) are required to unlock larger improvements.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle tested refinements at the geometric and filtering boundaries of the proven design (0.71 reduction factor + 25% stash). Both directions regressed: increasing geometric aggressiveness to 0.75 overshot the collision-reduction optimum, and collision-aware stash filtering eliminated valuable recoveries without net gain. v003's relative victory (despite hurting hit-rate) reflects convergence to a local optimum; the parent design appears to be the better-positioned point in the combined geometric-capacity-filtering design space.

## Patterns

- **Local optimum is stable**: The parent design's 0.71 geometric factor and unconditional 25%-capacity stash insertion represent a local equilibrium. Pushing geometry more aggressive (0.75) and filtering more selective (collision-aware threshold) both moved away from peak performance, indicating the system has settled into a well-balanced configuration with limited room for refinement within these axes.

- **Unconditional capture remains optimal**: v003 tested collision-aware selective insertion, filtering evictions from low-contention buckets to reduce stash pollution. The result contradicts the hypothesis—blanket FIFO insertion at 25% capacity captures all meaningful re-uses, and collision frequency does not predict recovery value. This replicates Cycle 0003's occupancy-filtering finding with a different signal; filtering is not a productive axis regardless of the signal chosen.

- **Geometric refinement has tightened bounds**: v001's regression when pushing from 0.71 to 0.75 confirms that collision-reduction gains have saturated. The design space is now constrained; v002 from Cycle 0004 (0.71) sits near the peak, and both higher and lower directions yield diminishing or negative returns. Further geometric exploration requires narrower, more expensive searches.

- **Architectural constraints continue to block capacity exploration**: v002's build failure (borrow checker error on stash insertion sequencing) persists as the third instance across cycles. Stash capacity scaling beyond 25%—a direction validated earlier—remains technically blocked, leaving the capacity saturation frontier unmapped.

## Open questions

- Is the geometric optimum precisely at 0.71, or is there a fractional refinement (0.68–0.70 or 0.72–0.73) that yields incremental gains within a narrower range?
- Can the architectural constraint preventing stash capacity scaling be resolved through refactoring, or does it reflect a fundamental limit of the bucket-level locking model?
- Has the workload-cache pairing exhausted its exploitable margin, or do entirely different levers (workload phase adaptation, eviction policies orthogonal to FIFO, collision-reduction through alternative bucket-layout strategies) remain?

## Continuation

v003's win, though accompanied by regression, confirms convergence to a local optimum around 0.71 and 25% capacity. Both geometry refinement (pushing to 0.75) and filtering (collision-aware threshold) moved away from peak, indicating the parent design is well-positioned. Next cycle should pursue one of two paths: (1) **Fine-grained local search**: test geometric factors in the 0.68–0.73 range at smaller increments to locate the precise peak and verify whether small adjustments yield marginal gains within the convergence zone, or (2) **Escape the local optimum**: accept that stash-geometry tuning has saturated and pivot to fundamentally different optimization axes (workload phase detection and dynamic adaptation, alternative collision-reduction strategies orthogonal to bucket width, or adaptive eviction policies beyond FIFO). Resolve the borrow checker constraint if pursuing stash-capacity exploration, but deprioritize it unless fine-grained local search confirms the need for larger capacity to support new geometric configurations.
