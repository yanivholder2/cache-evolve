# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cohort tested three orthogonal approaches to improve upon ClassicLRU: replacing item-movement bookkeeping with timestamp updates (TimestampLRU), minimizing bookkeeping entirely (FIFO), and consolidating cache geometry into wider, denser buckets (64 × 32). All three variants regressed on per-operation latency by 40–45%, while hit-rate either held steady or improved modestly (+0.24%). No variant achieved a fitness win over the baseline, revealing that ClassicLRU is not just a reasonable policy for this workload but a particulary well-optimized implementation of one.

## Patterns

- **Latency regressed uniformly despite different mechanisms**: Whether changing eviction policy (TimestampLRU, FIFO) or cache geometry (wider buckets), all variants slowed by ~40–45% on per-op time, suggesting ClassicLRU's vector operations on small buckets (16 items) have unusually good cache locality or compiler optimization that alternatives could not match.
- **Hit-rate insensitivity to policy details**: FIFO maintained 0.6611 hit-rate despite dropping recency awareness entirely, confirming that Zipfian access patterns alone can sustain high hit-rate without explicit recency tracking. TimestampLRU also held 0.6611, showing the bookkeeping method is orthogonal to hit-rate. Only geometry change (V002) moved hit-rate (+0.24%), but at a larger latency cost than policy changes.
- **Geometry trade-off: hash table vs. bucket scan**: Wider buckets (64 × 32) improved cache density and hit-rate but increased the cost of sequential intra-bucket searches, suggesting that for this workload, the latency penalty of scanning longer lists outweighs the benefit of fewer hash table lookups and better memory packing.
- **Theory-practice inversion deepens**: V001 (TimestampLRU) pursued O(1) timestamping vs. ClassicLRU's O(n) vector ops, yet achieved worse latency. This repeats the pattern from cycle 0001's Swap variant: asymptotic complexity gains evaporate under cache-level micro-architecture and implementation overhead.

## Open questions

- Why does ClassicLRU's O(n) vector manipulation (remove + append on 16-item vectors) outperform O(1) timestamp updates or zero-cost FIFO hits? Is the answer cache line coherency, branch prediction stability, or compiler loop optimization?
- Does the current geometry (128 × 16) happen to be locally optimal for this Zipfian workload and benchmark scale, or is it more broadly robust?
- Would batched or vectorized bucket scans recover the geometry advantage, or is the per-item cost of scanning inherently the bottleneck?

## Continuation

ClassicLRU appears not simply correct but finely optimized for this workload and hardware—attempts to improve hit-rate, reduce bookkeeping, or tune geometry all degraded latency without achieving a net fitness gain. Rather than continuing policy or geometry variations, the next cycle should: (1) understand *why* ClassicLRU is fast (profile micro-architectural effects, examine compiled code patterns), (2) test ClassicLRU's robustness across different workload distributions, cache sizes, or multi-core scenarios to identify conditions where it breaks, or (3) explore implementation-level refinements (prefetching, cache-aligned layouts, vectorization) that preserve ClassicLRU's performance profile while addressing potential bottlenecks outside the policy itself. If policy is revisited, focus on hybrid or adaptive strategies that can fall back to ClassicLRU's proven efficiency rather than replacement.
