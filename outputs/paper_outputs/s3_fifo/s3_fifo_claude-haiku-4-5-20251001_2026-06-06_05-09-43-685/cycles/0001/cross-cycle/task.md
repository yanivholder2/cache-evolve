## Cohort outcome

All three winners pursued tighter admission filtering and queue resizing to reduce main-queue population and contention, achieving significant per-operation latency gains (28–66% faster operations across variants). However, all three winners trade hit-rate for these latency wins—v001 shows marginal miss impact, while v002 and v003 incur 8%+ hit-rate declines.

## Patterns

- **Latency-first trade-off**: Every variant in this cohort improves operation latency by constraining main-queue size, either through stricter promotion thresholds (v001, v002) or queue resizing (v003). The consistency suggests that reduced main-queue contention and lookup chains are a reliable latency lever.

- **Hit-rate as the cost**: The cohort reveals a fundamental tension: filtering that reduces main-queue noise also blocks items that would have been retained by looser admission. Ghost-hit re-routing (v002) and higher promotion thresholds (v001) both penalize moderately-accessed items that cannot meet stricter validation gates.

- **Workload sensitivity**: v003's unexpected latency improvement despite hit-rate decline suggests the workload benefits from smaller resident set and less eviction overhead. The three variants succeed at different severity levels, implying the trade-off frontier is workload-dependent.

## Open questions

- Can we recover hit-rate without sacrificing the latency gains—e.g., through smarter promotion heuristics or frequency-count decay?
- Do these variants cluster differently on synthetic vs. real-world access patterns?
- Is there a sweet spot where modest latency sacrifice recovers meaningful hit-rate, or is the frontier binary?

## Continuation

The cohort converges on **admission-filter tightness as a primary latency lever**. If latency is the priority metric, these variants form a solid foundation—v001 with marginal hit-rate cost is the most balanced, while v002 and v003 are extremes. **For the next cycle, either:** (1) accept the latency-first stance and optimize filter parameters further (frequency thresholds, queue sizing ratios); (2) explore frequency-decay or recency-weighted heuristics to recover hit-rate within the same tighter-filtering framework; or (3) test adaptive thresholds that adjust per workload phase to balance both metrics. Avoid looser admission filters; the cohort strongly signals they backfire.
