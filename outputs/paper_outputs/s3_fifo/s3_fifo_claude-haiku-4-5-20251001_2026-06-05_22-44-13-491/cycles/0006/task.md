### Cycle 0003

# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three refinements were tested: further tightening the small-queue admission gate (1/5 → 1/6), raising the frequency threshold for small-to-main promotion (freq>1 → freq>2), and combining structural selectivity with frequency-depth (1/5 + MAX_FREQ=4). The winner (v001) continued Cycle 0002's structural-selectivity trend, confirming that shrinking the small-queue admission barrier remains the dominant improvement lever. v003 validated that frequency-depth and structural selectivity are genuinely orthogonal axes, though v001's selectivity gain proves larger in this cycle.

## Patterns

- **Structural selectivity (small-queue reduction) remains the dominant lever**: v001's further tightening from 1/5 to 1/6 delivered clear hit-rate gains, while v002's attempt to raise the promotion frequency threshold (freq>1 → freq>2) hurt performance. This clarifies that the selectivity dimension is *size-based admission gating*, not frequency-threshold tuning. The workload continues to reward fewer but better-filtered items in the small queue.

- **Frequency-depth and structural selectivity are orthogonal but unequally weighted**: v003 confirmed that increasing MAX_FREQ from 3 to 4 while keeping the 1/5 gate produced gains, validating Cycle 0001's frequency-depth finding. However, v001's size-based reduction outperformed v003, indicating the current small-queue capacity is the higher-leverage axis. The two dimensions compound but do not carry equal importance.

- **Promotion selectivity via frequency threshold is a dead-end**: v002's stricter frequency gate contradicts the Cycle 0002 insight that "admission selectivity works." The difference is mechanistic: v002 tightens the *graduation threshold* (who leaves small for main), while v001/Cycle 0002 v003 tighten the *entry capacity* (how many can occupy small). Size-based filtering outperforms frequency-based filtering at this decision point.

## Open questions

- How far can small-queue reduction continue? Does the gain persist from 1/6 to 1/7 or 1/8, or is there a utilization cliff approaching where the queue cannot absorb sufficient working-set diversity?
- Can v001's structural gain (1/6) and v003's frequency gain (MAX_FREQ=4) compound into a single variant? If so, is the combined improvement larger than either individually?
- Why does frequency-threshold selectivity (v002) fail while size-based selectivity succeeds? Is it that frequency signals are too coarse-grained at the small-queue promotion stage, or that the frequency mechanism cannot support this decision point?

## Continuation

Drop frequency-threshold tuning at the promotion gate (v002-type experiments); three cycles of evidence—Cycles 0001 v002 (freq boost on ghost hits), 0002 v002 (freq credits), and 0003 v002 (stricter promotion frequency)—consistently show frequency-based selectivity fails at this scale. Continue aggressive small-queue reduction (test 1/7, 1/8) to locate saturation, and combine the best small-queue size with MAX_FREQ=4 to verify orthogonal compounding. If gains continue below 1/6, investigate whether reuse-depth distribution analysis could predict optimal sizing *a priori* for future workloads.


### Cycle 0004

# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three refinements were tested on the small-queue structural-selectivity axis: incremental reduction to 1/7, orthogonal compounding with frequency-depth (1/6 + MAX_FREQ=4), and aggressive reduction to 1/8. The winner (v003) pushed structural selectivity further, confirming that the saturation boundary for admission-gate tightening remains unlocated. Stricter small-queue filtering continues to outperform both incremental steps and attempts to compound orthogonal optimizations, indicating the workload still sits well below its utilization cliff.

## Patterns

- **Aggressive structural selectivity outperforms incremental and orthogonal approaches**: v003's jump from 1/6 to 1/8 delivered larger gains than v001's incremental 1/6→1/7 step and v002's orthogonal combination of 1/6 + MAX_FREQ=4. Four consecutive cycles (0002 v003, 0003 v001/v003, 0004 v003) confirm that small-queue reduction remains the single most effective lever; the workload rewards increasingly selective admission filtering without sign of diminishing returns.

- **Saturation boundary is further out than expected**: Both v001 (1/7) and v003 (1/8) report positive hit-rate impact with no performance cliff. The workload demonstrates robustness to aggressive under-provisioning of the small queue—items demonstrating genuine reuse still graduate successfully to main-queue storage, and frequency selectivity (freq > 1 for promotion) effectively separates signal from noise even at tighter capacities.

- **Orthogonal compounding works but remains subordinate to structural selectivity**: v002's combination of 1/6 structural selectivity + MAX_FREQ=4 improved hit-rate and validated that frequency-depth and admission-gate sizing are genuinely orthogonal axes. However, v003's larger gains from going to 1/8 confirm that structural selectivity is currently the higher-leverage dimension—frequency-depth offers complementary but smaller absolute improvements at this stage.

## Open questions

- How far can small-queue reduction continue? Does the trend persist at 1/9 or 1/10, or does 1/8 approach the saturation cliff where working-set diversity becomes over-constrained?
- If v003's 1/8 reduction is paired with MAX_FREQ=4, do the two optimizations compound to deliver even larger gains than either achieved alone?
- Can workload characteristics (reuse-depth histogram, inter-arrival burstiness) predict the optimal small-queue ratio *a priori*, allowing future cycles to target the saturation boundary directly rather than search incrementally?

## Continuation

The structural-selectivity axis remains dominant and has not yet hit saturation. Aggressively push small-queue reduction to find the utilization cliff: test 1/9 and 1/10 to locate the boundary where performance degrades. Simultaneously, test v003's 1/8 + MAX_FREQ=4 combination to confirm whether aggressive structural selectivity and frequency-depth compound synergistically at the boundary. Once saturation is mapped, shift focus to workload-adaptive or learned admission policies that might exceed fixed-ratio boundaries, or investigate whether the observed selectivity gains transfer to different workload patterns.


### Cycle 0005

# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

Three refinements continued the structural-selectivity axis: incremental reduction to 1/9, aggressive reduction to 1/10, and orthogonal compounding of 1/8 with MAX_FREQ=5. The winner (v002) pushed small-queue reduction to 1/10 and delivered measurable improvement, extending the monotonic trend unbroken across four consecutive cycles. Notably, neither incremental reduction (v001) nor orthogonal compounding (v003) outperformed the pure structural play, confirming that tight admission-gate selectivity remains the dominant and unsaturated lever.

## Patterns

- **Structural selectivity shows no saturation sign despite five reduction steps**: The progression 1/4→1/5→1/6→1/8→1/9→1/10 has yielded consistent hit-rate improvements with no degradation or cliff. v002's aggressive 1/10 jump delivered the largest gain, and v001's incremental 1/9 step also improved despite smaller magnitude. This is a remarkable pattern: the workload continues to reward increasingly selective admission filtering at a scale (1/10 of capacity) that would be expected to trigger utilization collapse. The fact that items with genuine reuse still graduate successfully through the frequency gate suggests the workload exhibits exceptionally strong reuse locality—signal and noise are clearly separable even at extreme selectivity.

- **Diminishing returns have not yet appeared**: v001 notes "diminishing magnitude" compared to prior cycles, yet still improved. This is consistent with a gradual approach to saturation rather than an abrupt cliff. The workload appears to tolerate over-constrained small-queue sizing without failing to capture the working set, indicating the access patterns are skewed enough that frequency-based promotion (freq > 1) effectively filters repeaters even under extreme pressure.

- **Frequency-depth compounding remains complementary but subordinate**: v003's combination of 1/8 structural selectivity + MAX_FREQ=5 showed "modest but consistent improvement" and validated orthogonal compounding once more. However, v002's pure structural approach (1/10) outperformed v003, reaffirming that at this stage, tight admission-gate sizing is the higher-leverage axis. The pattern is now five cycles deep: frequency-depth and structural selectivity are orthogonal, but structural selectivity is the dominant lever by a wide margin.

## Open questions

- **Where is the true saturation boundary?** All variants this cycle improved; does the trend continue at 1/11 or 1/12, or do we find degradation soon? The absence of a cliff at 1/10 is surprising and warrants aggressive boundary search.

- **Does saturation manifest abruptly or gradually?** If saturation exists, does performance degrade sharply (utilization cliff) or gently (frequency signals become too coarse to distinguish reuse)? This affects how aggressively future cycles should search.

- **Is the extreme selectivity (1/10+) specific to this workload, or indicative of a deeper architectural mismatch?** The workload's tolerance for 1/10-ratio admission suggests either exceptional reuse clustering or that S3-FIFO's frequency mechanism is detecting signal in regimes where many cache policies would fail. Could a different admission policy (e.g., learned, adaptive, or frequency-weighted from the start) exceed fixed-ratio boundaries?

## Continuation

The structural-selectivity axis remains dominant and has not yet hit saturation—continue the aggressive boundary search. Test 1/11 and 1/12 to locate the actual utilization cliff or confirm that selectivity gains persist even further. Once saturation is mapped with confidence, investigate whether workload characteristics (reuse-depth histogram, burstiness, skew) can predict the optimal ratio *a priori*, enabling the next workload's cycles to target the saturation boundary directly rather than search incrementally. If saturation occurs beyond 1/12, pivot to adaptive or learned admission policies that might dynamically adjust selectivity per-phase rather than rely on fixed structural constants.
