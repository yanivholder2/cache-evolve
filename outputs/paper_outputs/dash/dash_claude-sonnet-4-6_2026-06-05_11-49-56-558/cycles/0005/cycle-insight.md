# Cycle 0005 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants probed insertion-position ordering — ghost re-admission positioning, a canonical promotion/demotion asymmetry in the normal tier, and a probationary zone in probing — and all three regressed relative to the parent. v001 won by being the least harmful: ghost re-admission at MRU produced only marginal noise, while the other two incurred clear regressions.

## Patterns

- **MRU positioning dominates universally on workload-a.** Every attempt to withhold MRU status — whether at the ghost re-admission boundary, the demotion cascade, or the probing entry point — hurt hit-rate. The workload's reuse gaps are short enough that displaced or newly-promoted items reliably get re-accessed before eviction, making probationary or LRU-entry positioning consistently punishing rather than protective.
- **The ghost set is now exhausted as a lever in all configurations.** Back-insert on re-admission moved the needle marginally in the wrong direction, confirming the earlier finding that ghost re-admission delivers noise-level movement regardless of position. The stash eviction boundary simply is not where meaningful hit-rate is lost on this workload.
- **Textbook segmented-LRU asymmetry (promotions at MRU, demotions at LRU) is contraindicated here.** The standard design assumes a clean hot/cold divide, but workload-a's access distribution is warm throughout — items displaced by a hot promotion still have residual heat, and inheriting MRU position in the destination tier is what preserves their next hit. Removing that buffer accelerates churn rather than improving selectivity.

## Open questions

- With MRU universally dominant, is there any meaningful insertion-ordering axis left to probe, or has this design axis been fully exhausted?
- Would workload-a behave differently under a capacity stress test (smaller total cache size), where probationary filtering might finally pay off because good eviction decisions matter more at the margin?
- Is there a genuinely new structural mechanism — adaptive segment sizing, size-aware eviction, or TTL-based decay — that workload-a's stable hot set would respond to?

## Continuation

The ghost set should be permanently retired; it has been shown noise-level across multiple position and size configurations. The universal MRU finding should be encoded as a constraint: any future variant that inserts at LRU/Front for newly-arriving or re-admitted items is likely to regress on workload-a. The search space under the current design appears close to exhausted; the next hypotheses-writer should either introduce a structurally new mechanism (adaptive sizing, eviction cost weighting) or switch to a second workload trace where cold-item churn or scan traffic would make probationary and frequency-aware schemes genuinely competitive.
