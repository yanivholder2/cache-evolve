# Cycle 0003 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle moved past the split-ratio sweep that dominated cycles 0001–0002
and probed three distinct geometry/promotion levers: pushing the normal/stash
split one step further, accelerating promotion via MRU insert position, and
trading bucket count for bucket width. The winner (v002) was the
promotion-position flip, but its gain was only a sliver; the split-push barely
turned over, and the width-for-count trade regressed.

## Patterns

- The capacity-reallocation axis is now confirmed saturated: pushing the split
  past the prior winner did not climb and edged fractionally lower, pinning the
  hit-rate peak at or just past the inherited ratio rather than deeper toward
  the baseline. The over-provisioned-stash story from cycle 0001 has been fully
  corrected — further starving the stash now costs admission as much as it saves.
- The protected tier's internal levers are mostly exhausted on this trace. The
  winning promotion-position change (insert at MRU so hot keys climb in one
  follow-up access) helped only marginally, because high-skew re-touch is fast
  enough that the "earn your way up" delay was barely costing hits.
- Bucket addressability beats bucket depth at conserved budget: widening
  buckets while halving their count regressed, so hot keys collided into fewer
  landing spots. Bucket count is a value to preserve, not a free associativity
  knob to spend.

## Open questions

- With both the split axis and the promotion-position lever now near-exhausted,
  where is the next real source of hit-rate on this skewed trace? Every
  geometry/promotion lever touched so far yields diminishing returns.
- Has the cohort over-fit to a single high-skew LIRS trace? The flattening of
  every lever may be a property of this workload rather than of the design.

## Continuation

Treat the normal/stash split and the protected-tier promotion mechanics as
settled — both are near their peak and further probes there will only return
slivers or regressions. Drop bucket-widening entirely (count dominates width).
Next cycle should look outside the geometry/promotion family that cycles 0001–0003
exhausted: explore admission/eviction dynamics, segment count, or validate
against a second, less-skewed trace before assuming any lever generalizes.
