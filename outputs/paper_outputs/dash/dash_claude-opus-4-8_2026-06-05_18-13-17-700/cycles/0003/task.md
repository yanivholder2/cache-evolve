### Cycle 0001

# Cycle 0001 Insight

## Cohort outcome

All three variants were single-lever reshapes of the baseline DASH tiering,
each targeting hit-rate on a skewed trace without touching capacity. The
winner (v002) repartitioned fixed budget toward the promotion-protected
normal tier; the two stash-admission tweaks (v001 back-insertion, v003
frequency gate) also moved hit-rate favorably but did not top it.

## Patterns

- Every variant converged on the same lever family: protect the warm working
  set in the normal tier by reducing how easily transient keys disturb it,
  whether via capacity reallocation, insertion position, or a promotion gate.
- The baseline appears to over-provision the cold stash admission area; both
  shrinking it (v002) and making it more selective (v001, v003) helped, which
  points to a single underlying weakness rather than three independent ones.
- All wins were budget-conserving and invariant-preserving — no dimension
  regressed in any variant, so the cohort moved along one axis (hit-rate)
  with no observed trade-off cost.

## Open questions

- Are these levers additive or redundant? They each attack the same
  stash-vs-normal imbalance, so stacking v002 with v001/v003 may yield
  diminishing or conflicting returns.
- Both v002's split ratio and v003's promote threshold are unswept knobs; the
  reported wins are single points, not optima.
- Results rest on one skewed trace; the stash-protection bias may not
  generalize to less skewed or churn-heavy workloads.

## Continuation

Pursue the stash-vs-normal balance as the dominant theme — the winning move
was reallocating budget to the protected tier. Next cycle should sweep the
v002 split ratio and v003 threshold for optima, and test whether combining
the split shift with a selective stash gate compounds or cancels. Drop pure
re-runs of single-lever baselines; the cohort has established the direction.


### Cycle 0002

# Cycle 0002 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle probed three follow-ups to the cycle-0001 stash-vs-normal theme:
pushing the bucket split further toward the protected tier, stacking a
selective stash gate on the even split, and swapping the protected tier's
eviction policy. The winner (v001) pushed the split past even toward
normal-dominant and kept gaining hit-rate; the gate-stacking and policy-swap
variants did not improve on it.

## Patterns

- The capacity-reallocation axis from cycle 0001 has not yet saturated:
  moving budget further into the promotion-protected normal tier (even →
  normal-dominant) still climbed hit-rate, so the optimum lies beyond the
  even point — the baseline stash was over-provisioned more than one step
  could correct.
- The two stash-protection levers proved redundant, not additive: once the
  protected tier was enlarged by capacity, layering a selective-admission
  frequency gate on top yielded steeply diminishing returns. Most of the
  available benefit is captured by *how much* room the protected tier gets.
- Changing *how* the protected tier ranks residents was a dead lever:
  forcing LFU eviction onto the normal tier regressed, since the trace's
  skew is already well-served by recency/promote-on-hit and LFU retained
  stale-but-frequent keys over the live working set.
- All movement stayed budget-conserving and invariant-preserving; the only
  regression came from the policy swap, not from any capacity reshape.

## Open questions

- Where exactly does the normal-dominant split stop paying off — is there a
  point where too small a stash starves admission and regresses? The curve
  is still rising but unbounded sampling hasn't found its peak.
- Are there protected-tier levers beyond capacity and eviction-policy that
  haven't been touched (e.g. promotion position, segment count)?

## Continuation

Keep sweeping the normal/stash split toward the normal tier to bracket the
hit-rate peak — v001 confirms the curve is still climbing, so push past 3:1
until it turns over, then back off. Drop two directions as settled: stacking
selective-admission gates on top of the capacity reshape (redundant), and
swapping the protected tier's eviction policy to LFU (regresses). If the
split curve flattens, shift to an untried protected-tier lever rather than
re-running admission filters.
