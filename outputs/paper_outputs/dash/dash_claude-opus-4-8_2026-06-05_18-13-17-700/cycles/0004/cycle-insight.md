# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle finally left the saturated split/promotion-position family and
probed three new admission/eviction-dynamics levers: widening the
target→probing promotion *gate* (top-quarter instead of strict-hottest),
removing stash admission probation entirely, and re-landing demoted keys at
MRU. The winner (v001) was the widened gate, but its gain was only a sliver;
the demotion-MRU change (v003) also lifted hit-rate, while removing stash
admission (v002) regressed sharply.

## Patterns

- The stash's admission step is confirmed as warm-set protection, not dead
  probation: eliminating it let cold one-hit-wonders displace resident hot
  keys and cascaded the working set out, regressing well below baseline. The
  "over-provisioned stash" theme from cycles 0001–0002 had a floor — the
  stash filter itself is load-bearing and must not be removed.
- The promotion *gate* is a real but bottlenecked lever. Admitting more of
  the warm set into probing is directionally correct, but on this heavily
  hashed trace target buckets are usually too small for the quarter rule to
  engage, so the small-bucket fallback caps the gain.
- The demotion-path insert position is a genuinely independent lever from the
  hit-path position that prior cycles exhausted. Keeping probing-evicted keys
  at the MRU end protects the oscillating LIRS working set and gains hit-rate
  where the hit-path position had already flattened.

## Open questions

- Both winning levers (gate width, demotion MRU) gave only slivers and are
  gated by bucket occupancy — is there headroom if target buckets were
  denser, or does the trace's hashing structurally cap them?
- Are v001's gate widening and v003's demotion-MRU additive, or do they both
  chase the same small pool of boundary-oscillating keys?
- Every lever's reach now seems bounded by bucket occupancy and trace skew;
  has the cohort over-fit to this single high-skew trace?

## Continuation

Treat stash admission as settled and protective — do not probe removing or
gutting it again. The live frontier is eviction/demotion dynamics: v003's
demotion-MRU landing is the freshest real lever and worth combining with
v001's widened gate to test additivity. The promotion gate is real but
occupancy-bottlenecked, so any further gate work should target a fractional
rule that engages below small-bucket thresholds rather than re-running the
quarter rule. Before investing more, validate these slivers against a
second, less-skewed trace — the diminishing returns may be a property of
this workload.
