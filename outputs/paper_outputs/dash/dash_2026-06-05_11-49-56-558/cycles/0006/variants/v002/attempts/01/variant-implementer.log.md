Now let me read the parent variant's files to understand what the current implementation looks like, and then the subject source file I need to modify.

### 14:04:09 thinking

Now let me also look at the parent variant's other overlaid files to understand what's been changed from the baseline:

### 14:04:10 chat

Now let me check what other files the parent variant overlaid:

}
```

### 14:04:19 thinking

Now let me read the parent variant's geometry.rs overlay too, since that's part of the inheritance chain:

### 14:04:19 tool: Read

```json
{
  "file_path": "/home/user/cache-evolve/outputs/dash_2026-06-05_11-49-56-558/cycles/0004/variants/v002/attempts/01/overlay/src/shared/geometry.rs"
}
```

### 14:06:15 thinking

Now I have a complete picture of what I need to do. The parent variant (cycle/0004/v002) has:
1. A `geometry.rs` that uses a 75/25 normal/stash split (24 normal + 8 stash for production settings)
2. A `dash_segment.rs` with ghost-set re-admission

My hypothesis says to:
1. Remove the ghost set entirely
2. Replace with second-chance promotion: when stash evicts an item, immediately place it at the Front of its target bucket

The hypothesis also says the `get` should use `InsertPosition::Back` (inherited from the parent variant), and the test `ghost_set_re_admission_bypasses_stash` should be replaced with a test verifying that a stash-evicted item appears in its target bucket immediately after the triggering `put`.


Looking at the parent's `dash_segment.rs`, I can see it's already been modified from the baseline with `InsertPosition::Back` in `promotion_get`, a `ghost_keys` field, and a `GHOST_CAPACITY` constant. I need to create an overlay that strips out the ghost set infrastructure, implements the second-chance promotion logic instead, updates the documentation, and replaces the existing ghost-set test with one that validates stash-evicted items land in their target bucket right after the triggering `put`.

The parent's test `stash_hit_inserts_at_back_of_target` differs from the baseline because it uses `InsertPosition::Back`, so I need to account for that difference. For the new second-chance test, I'll pre-fill a stash bucket to capacity and then trigger a `put` that causes an eviction, verifying the evicted item ends up in its target bucket rather than staying in the stash.

The key distinction from the ghost test is that the evicted item should immediately appear in the target bucket as a direct result of the triggering `put`, not from a subsequent re-insertion. When `put(trigger)` executes, it inserts the trigger into the stash, which forces the LRU item out—and in second-chance, that evicted item gets promoted straight to the front of its target bucket. So after this single `put` call, the evicted item should be in target, not stash.

Now I need to write the overlay file that includes both the inherited geometry.rs and the new dash_segment.rs test. scope is `extension-points`, which means I can only write to the impl files listed in the manifest's `[[extension-points]]` tables. Looking at the manifest, the segment extension point has:
```
impl-files = ["src/dash/segments/dash_segment.rs"]
```

The geometry extension point has:
```
impl-files = ["src/shared/geometry.rs"]
```

I need to write the `dash_segment.rs` file for the segment extension point, and I should also include `geometry.rs` in my overlay since the harness applies my overlay on top of the subject crate—the parent's overlay isn't automatically carried forward. Since the parent has `geometry.rs` overlaid and my hypothesis says it stays unchanged, I need to copy it to my overlay as well.

My overlay should contain both `src/shared/geometry.rs` (copied from parent unchanged) and `src/dash/segments/dash_segment.rs` (modified per hypothesis). Now I'm modifying `dash_segment.rs` by removing the `VecDeque` import and the related const...

Writing the modified segment file... not in stash. The test name `stash_eviction_second_chance_lands_in_target` captures what we're verifying. Now I'm writing out the full overlay file with the segment implementation that includes the second-chance promotion logic for stash-evicted items, where the `get` method realizes the promotion design by treating target and probing as a tier.

Writing struct definition... Implementing the trait methods for DashSegment... Writing Rust implementation... Writing test assertions...

Now I'm realizing there's a subtlety here—when we promote `fillers[0]` to its target bucket during the second-chance mechanism, if that target bucket is already full, it could evict something from the target itself and demote it to stash. The question is whether the evicted item would be `fillers[0]` again, which would only happen if the target is full and `fillers[0]` becomes the LRU candidate there. But the target bucket should still be empty at this point since we've only been filling the stash.

When `promote_to_target` is called with `fillers[0]`, it uses `InsertPosition::Front` to place the item at the LRU end of the target bucket, which aligns with the hypothesis that promoted items should go to the front. Since the target is empty, `fillers[0]` will definitely land there without triggering any eviction.

I should also verify that the inherited `stash_hit_inserts_at_back_of_target` test still works correctly, and check whether the `cascade_demotion_probing_to_full_target_to_stash` test would pass under these conditions.

Looking at that cascade test more carefully, the second-chance mechanism shouldn't interfere because the demotion cascade from probing uses `demote_from_normal_bucket`, which calls `core.put_at` directly rather than going through the `put` method where the second-chance logic lives. Let me trace through the parent variant to confirm... When I call `get` on that key at the back of the target bucket, it gets removed and promoted to the probing bucket at the MRU position. Since probing is already full, this triggers an eviction of the least recently used item from probing, which then gets demoted back to the normal bucket.

Now I need to trace through the actual sequence more carefully—starting from an empty state, I'm putting the first key which goes into stash, then getting it to promote it to the target bucket, then putting the second key which also flows through stash first.

After both puts and gets complete, the target bucket should contain both keys in LRU order while the stash should be empty since items get removed during promotion. But I'm checking the `promotion_get` logic to confirm whether items are actually removed from stash when promoted...

Yes, the removal happens—when an item is found in the stash, it's removed and then promoted to the target bucket. So after the get operations, stash is definitely empty.

The probing bucket gets filled directly with the probing keys, and then when I call get on the hottest item in target, it gets promoted to probing, which is already full, so the least recently used item in probing gets evicted and demoted back down.

Since that evicted item's true target bucket is the probing bucket itself, it ends up in the stash at the back position. The final state has the target bucket with one key, the probing bucket with two keys (the remaining probing key and the promoted key), and the stash with the demoted key. The assertion checks that the evicted key is now in the stash bucket.

Now I'm verifying the stash_hit_inserts_at_back_of_target test works correctly with the Back insertion position. When I hit a key in the stash and promote it to the target bucket, it should append to the back, so after two stash hits the target bucket contains both keys in order.

I'm also checking that the other existing tests still pass with this change—put_goes_to_stash, stash_hit_inserts_at_back_of_target, and target_hit_hottest_promotes_to_probing all hold up with the new insertion strategy. RU promotes ✓
- `probing_hit_touches_in_place`: probing hit doesn't change anything ✓
- `probing_eviction_demotes_to_target`: cascade logic unchanged ✓
- `cascade_demotion_probing_to_full_target_to_stash`: covered above ✓
- `miss_returns_none`: trivial ✓
- `last_bucket_probing_wraps_to_zero`: same logic as parent with Back ✓
- `evicted_from_probing_cascades_to_target`: uses `promote_to_probing` directly, unchanged ✓
- `target_retry_*`: use `promote_to_probing` directly, unchanged ✓
- `direct_to_stash_*`: use `promote_to_target` directly, unchanged ✓
- `cascade_to_stash_*`: use `promote_to_probing` directly, unchanged ✓

Actually, I need to reconsider the `last_bucket_probing_wraps_to_zero` test. The parent version uses `InsertPosition::Back` which immediately places keys at the hottest position, so after two puts and gets, the second key is already positioned as the most recently used. One more get then triggers the promotion to probing with wraparound at zero. This should still work. ✓

Now tracing through the `target_hit_hottest_promotes_to_probing` test with `Insert Position::Back`: after the initial operations, keys[1] ends up at the MRU position in the target bucket, making it the hottest item. Since ClassicLRU's promotion logic identifies the MRU item as the candidate, keys[1] gets promoted to the probing bucket as expected. ✓

I'm satisfied with this implementation. Before I write it out, I need to verify that the `promote_to_target` function signature accepts the `InsertPosition` parameter correctly, since the second-chance eviction strategy requires using `InsertPosition::Front` when promoting items back.

Writing the complete implementation...

### 14:06:15 chat

Now I have all the context I need. Let me create the overlay files:

1. `src/shared/geometry.rs` — inherited unchanged from parent
2. `src/dash/segments/dash_segment.rs` — modified per hypothesis (remove ghost set, add second-chance promotion)

The overlay is written. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Changes applied

**`src/dash/segments/dash_segment.rs`** — modified per H02:

1. **Removed ghost set entirely**: dropped `use std::collections::VecDeque;`, the `GHOST_CAPACITY` constant, and the `ghost_keys: VecDeque<K>` field. Updated `try_new` to construct `Self { core }`.

2. **Replaced `put` logic**: the new `put` inserts into stash (same as before), but when the stash evicts an item, it immediately calls `promote_to_target(&mut self.core, ev, InsertPosition::Front)` — second-chance promotion at the LRU end of the target tier. No ghost-set record; no waiting for a future re-insertion event.

3. **`get` unchanged**: still `promotion_get(&mut self.core, key, InsertPosition::Back)` — inherited from the parent.

4. **Updated doc comment** to describe the second-chance mechanism.

5. **Replaced test** `ghost_set_re_admission_bypasses_stash` with `stash_eviction_second_chance_lands_in_target`, which verifies that the evicted stash item appears in its target bucket immediately after the triggering `put` — without any subsequent re-insertion.

**`src/shared/geometry.rs`** — inherited unchanged from parent (75/25 normal/stash split).
