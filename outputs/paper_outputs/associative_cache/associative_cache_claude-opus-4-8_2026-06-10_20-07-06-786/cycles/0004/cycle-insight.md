# Cycle 0004 Insight

## Cohort outcome

This cycle attacked the inherited FIFO-probation segmented-LRU from three
directions — a stricter two-hit promotion threshold (v001), a capped
protected segment with demotion-to-probation (v002), and a CLOCK
reference-bit substitute for recency ordering (v003). None beat the parent:
all three regressed hit-rate. v001 was carried as the Winner only as the
least-harmful change; the prior FIFO baseline effectively stands unimproved.

## Patterns

- Every variant lost by *withholding or stripping protection* from keys the
  parent kept. Raising the promotion bar (v001) stranded once-hit keys in
  FIFO until eviction; capping the protected segment (v002) demoted proven
  hot keys back into harm's way; CLOCK (v003) discarded the fine recency
  ranking that shielded warm keys. The trace punishes any scheme that makes
  earned protection harder to get or easier to lose.
- This confirms a multi-cycle boundary: one probationary hit is sufficient
  proof of reuse here, and the protected segment is load-bearing and does
  not want shrinking. Both the second-hit threshold (this cycle) and counter
  aging / front-admission (earlier cycles) failed for the same reason —
  they erode durable protection on a collision-bound trace.
- Recency granularity matters: a coarse one-bit reprieve underperforms full
  positional ranking in small buckets, so recency ordering is not safely
  approximated away.

## Open questions

- With promotion threshold, protected cap, and recency approximation all
  ruled out, is the FIFO-probation + promote-on-first-hit scheme at or near
  its hit-rate ceiling on this trace?
- Is there a *looser* protected sizing (larger, not capped) that helps, or
  is the current implicit split already optimal?
- Are the remaining gains now cost-side only (banking the per-op savings
  from reorder-free tiebreak) rather than hit-rate?

## Continuation

Keep Cycle 0003's FIFO-probation segmented-LRU as the baseline; this cycle
produced no hit-rate improvement on it. Stop probing protection-tightening
levers — second-hit thresholds, protected caps, and recency approximations
have now each failed for the same protection-erosion reason. Redirect the
next cycle toward (a) cost-side wins such as composing the reorder-free
tiebreak to bank per-op savings, and (b) untested hit-rate axes like looser
protected sizing or bucket geometry interactions, since the admission and
promotion logic appears saturated.
