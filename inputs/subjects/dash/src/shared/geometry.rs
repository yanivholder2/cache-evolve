//! In-crate bucket-geometry implementation — the overlayable extension point.

//! `numOfSegments`, `numOfNormalBuckets`, `numOfStashBuckets`, `bucketSize`),
//! so the baseline topology is unchanged. A variant overlays this file to
//! repartition the *same* total capacity differently — for example a wider
//! stash, fewer-but-wider normal buckets, or more segments — while keeping the
//! `BaselineGeometry` type name the construction glue references.
